Introduction
------------
Okay, Wasteland is the greatest CRPG ever written. However, it seems unlikely
that there will be a sequel or even a remake. Electronic Arts is holding the
rights to the game, as well as Bard's Tale, and they are currently sitting on
it, for what reason, no one knows.

Anyways, this game takes place after WW]I[, and your characters are a band of
intrepid Desert Rangers. You start out at the Ranger Center, in the bottom
right of the desert map.

+ What's New
+ ----------

+ 2.3a: Just added an extra note or two here and there.

2.3: I found the character editor!!! I was going through some 3.5"s, which
I have not used in like five years, and there it was, and completely virus-
free. I will package up this walkthrough with the editor and possibly the
paragraphs.

Fallout is out, and it looks goooood. The retro-fifties look is neat, and
the carnage is oh so delicious. Dudes getting their arms ripped off and
huge chunks blown off their torsos. I love it.

2.2: This version is almost the same as 2.1, but I had since lost the char
editor I had to the Yankee Doodle virus. The virus has thankfully been
eradicated. I know that if I were to say that if I ever track down the
dickless little piece of SHIT (pardon my French) that I'd wring his scrawny
neck until his eyes bulged out of his sockets and he squealed like a pig,
it would be just the sort of thing that he'd get off on, so I'm not going
to comment on it at all.
Anyways, the point is, that I have yet to find another copy of the char
editor, and I have had leads on the paragraph book, but I haven't had the
time to follow up on them.
Really new stuff: Interplay is working on a new Post-Nuclear-holocaust RPG
called Fallout. It's not Wasteland ][, but it looks pretty damn good.
I'd just like to cast my vote and be heard right now:
1. I really don't care a flying fig about GURPS, and would have bought the
game either way.
2. I like turn-based combat, not frenzied mouse-clicking. Diablo was nifty,
but after an hour or two it got REALLY boring (no offense to Blizzard)
3. I'm not really a fan of multiplayer games.
Anyways again, with the development of this new game, Wasteland has been
getting a lot of attention again lately. There are several Websites devoted
to it, and if you search for Wasteland in Excite or Altavista (I refuse to
get involved in any search engine arguments, so don't bother to tell me
"such and such's search engine is better than such and such's"), you should
be able to come up with several viable hits. One in particular is called
Ranger HQ, and has, as far as I can tell, ALL the secrets to all the
versions (IBM, C64, Apple][). It's also laid out quite niftily. Check it
out.

2.1: This version of the walkthrough is almost completely the same as version
ver 2.0, except for the addition of the info on the Superloot bags, and other
misc info. Anything new is marked with a '+' at the beginning of the line.
As it is, this is probably the last version of this I'm going to write,
I don't think there is anything else that I have missed.
Maybe I'll package this up with the character editor that I dug up, and
perhaps a copy of the Paragraphs text file. If I feel like it.

Acknowledgements
----------------
I'd like to take this opportunity to thank everyone for their enthusiasm,
without which this new version would never have been written. Thanks to the
people who helped me with the superloot cheat.

Thanks also to Mark Wigandt for the bit about the Power of the Force just
outside of the Stagecoach Inn in Quartz. You hoser. :)

General Survival Info
---------------------
Generally, if one of your characters dies, quit and restore. DON'T GO
ANYWHERE!! The game will autosave, and you're screwed.

Always save after leaving a shop. Due to the nature of the autosave, if you
leave a shop and then get attacked and die, the saved game location will be
in the shop. When it loads up again, it kills the shop. I learned this one
the hard way in Highpool, but it could happen anywhere, and if it happens in
a place like Darwin or Needles, you're screwed.

Macros cab be useful and aggravation-preventing. I usualy set F10 to like 50
ESCs. This makes resting a lot faster.

Always give everyone a canteen each. Then you can walk anywhere in the
desert. You can also rest safely in the deep desert.

The Paragraph Book is absolutely necessary for playing this game. I can't
give you all the info.

Creating Characters
-------------------
You start with four prefab chars. These guys suck dirt. First thing you
wanna do is trade the guns off the last three guys, and delete them.

Create one character, and trade all the guns to him. Then delete the other
useless dude.

Thing to keep in mind when creating chars
------------------------------------------
Keep rerolling the stats until you get an 18 in IQ. This will get you the
most possible starting Skill Points.

Important Skills for all characters:
        Assault Rifle
        SMG
        Medic

Important skills for at least one character:
        Climb
        Bomb Disarm
        Swim
        Perception
        Picklock
        Safecrack
        Silent Move
        Cryptology
        
Nifty extra skills:
        Combat Shooting
        Acrobat

The Great Desert Ranger Surplus Scam
------------------------------------
Create three characters using the above rules. Go to their inventories,
and drop  everything except the guns. Yes, even the ammo.

Then set up a macro (CTRL-Fkey):
1. Create a char. Hit Enter no matter what the stats.
2. Name it anything.
3. Hit Enter on the Skills list.
4. Keep the char.
5. Bring up the inventory, and trade the gun to the first char.
6. delete the dummy char.

End the macro, and fill up the first guy's inventory with guns. Repeat with
the second and third characters, until they are all filled up with guns.

Create your last character as above. Equip each char with a VP91Z (if your
last char has one, rejoice, and hold onto the ammo for later. Otherwise, just
drop everything and grab a VP9 from someone else), and head for Quartz.

In Quartz, go to the shop in the bottom left corner, and sell them off.
You should get around $6000.

Now, equip your dudes with M17s or M19s, and Bullet-proof shirts.
Also pick up a Canteen (essential for walking through hot spots) for each of
your chars. Also grab at least one crowbar, and a couple of ropes.

Highpool
--------
Camp Highpool should be the first stop on your trek through the Nevada desert.
Search around, and you'll find the shop. Open the door with a crowbar, and
kill the juvies that come to stop you. Check to table, and you'll find some
clues about what's going on here.

At the bottom right of the map, there is a building with some junk on the
floor. Check under the bed, and grab some stuff.

To the right of this is the most inexpensive doctor in the whole game.

Talk to Bobby in the bottom left corner. Ask him about his dog, the cave, and
Jackie. Use perception to find the cave on the left side, between two trees.
You'll need a rope to get in.

Cave
----
There's not a lot here. Just a dog, a crap NPC and a lot of smegging rocks.
Bobby's dog has rabies so put it out of its misery. You can use Jackie to
carry things for a while, but you're better off just getting rid of her.

Killing the Kiddies
-------------------
Fall into the river repeatedly, and the kids will come out of the woodwork to
laugh at you. Kill them if you want, but be careful. If you kill them in the
right combination, Red Ryder will come after you. If you kill him, then the
lake dries up, the place becomes a ghost town, and you'll lose the services
of a really cheap doctor.

By the way, Bobby isn't happy about you killing his dog. Give him a one way
ticket to mutie-kid heaven.

The Abandoned Mine
------------------
Don't go wandering around here until you have decent armor and automatic
weapons. After that, it's good for target practice. In the little room in the
corner, there's some Little People, and some gas masks in a crate.

Rail Nomads
-----------
Talk to the Brakeman when you enter, he'll tell you to go see the Headcrusher
in Scott's Bar in Quartz. He'll give you a Visa Card. Take it to Headcrusher,
and he'll tell you a password.

Go to the leftmost tent and give the password. You'll get a shovel, and some
instructions on where to dig. When you grab the stuff, you'll get attacked by
some ugly guys with crowbars.

The guys in the rightmost tent won't understand a word you say.

If you're feeling evil, give the password to the middle tent, and you can
wipe out the Topeka clan. Slaughtering women and children was never so much
fun.

Guardian Citadel
----------------
Don't even THINK about going in here yet. You can however use it as a
shortcut to Quartz. Just stay outside the little flags.

Quartz
------
Note: Resting here can be hazardous to your health. You can rest in an
abandoned building, but I've heard rumors of diseases.

Head for Scott's Bar, bottom right. The front door is easier. Talk to the
riddle dude at the top left. You can get a clue from the guy in the bathroom.
Then talk to Ellen over at the bar.

Stagecoach Inn
--------------
You can rest here safely.

Go to room 18, and talk to Laurie. Grab the stuff, and head back to the shop.
While you're there, grab a couple Snake Squeezins.

At the Inn, break into housekeeping. Grab the stuff from the shelves and the
cabinet. Kill the housekeepers, and bribe the bums to get out of the way.

Little known fact: If you walk north and stand on the tree just outside the
entrance and walk into the wall of the building directly north of you, it
gives you a message: "The power of the Force stopped you from that one, you
hoser." Just an interesting side note, doesn't have anything to do with the
rest of the game. I found out recently that it is a direct quote from
"Strange Brew", a SCTV movie spinoff that came out round about 1983, and
stars Rick Moranis and Dave Thomas (not the guy from Wendy's) as Bob and
Doug McKenzie. Beauty, eh?
+ Bob and Doug have recently been seen doing ads for Molson beer.

Courthouse
----------
Resting here is NOT recommended.

Pretty straightforward. Kill everyone. Go to the third floor, and kill the
guard, get the sonic key. Now go back to the second floor.

use the password and go to the right. Make sure your first character has
Silent Move, and go into the door. Pick up Dan Citrine, and head back to the
third floor.

Open the cells on the right, and pick up Mayor Pedros and get Dan's father's
money. Check out the paper on the desk on the left side of the building.

Fight your way out and sell off any and all extra stuff.

Hideout
-------
Do yourself a favor, and kill off the pistoleros one at a time, before you
pick up Ace, and save yourself some aggravation later.

Ugly John is waiting for you in the main room, at the bottom right. Don't
make any deals with him. Use bomb disarm twice, then use the plastic
explosive to open the vault.

Examine the map on the wall, and wait for it to dawn on you. The combo to the
safe is 11-16-27. Grab stuff, Ace is in the basement.

The Mayor and his wife can be let go once you've saved them.

Jeep
----
Ace can fix the jeep, but it's not really much use.

Needles
-------
Okay, this is a little more complicated than Quartz, so we'll go through it
one section at a time.

NE Needles
----------
There are several thing here. The ammo dump, the police station, the library,
and a doctor. The first two are most important.

Ammo Dump
---------
Grab everything you can. Be sure to get the Ruby Ring from the corpse.
The bloodstaff is fake.

Police Station
--------------
Go south past the desk, and talk to the detective about the Bloodstaff.
Turn off the security system in the room on the south side, and then grab the
ammo from the armory. Don't go into any of the training rooms, unless you
want target practice. You can pick up an NPC called Mort in one of the cells,
but don't bother, he's useless.

Library & Doctor
----------------
Duh.

SE Needles
----------
Take the ruby ring to the priest at the mushroom church. He'll talk to you
about the Bloodstaff.

SW Needles
----------
Garbage Dump. Go down and search the third level. You'll get attacked by the
Pit Ghoul. Unload full auto until he's dead. There are a couple of NATO
assault rifles and rad suits in one of the rooms.

Note: The train doesn't do much of anything useful.

Downtown Needles
----------------
This is where most of the stuff happens.

Downtown West
-------------
On the north side is a building with 2 guards. Inside is a Bloodstaff
Verification Device. Watch out for the cinderblock trap. Next to this place
is an old howitzer.

South of here is Hobo Dog. Be sure to pick up a Howitzer shell at the ammo
dump and use it on the howitzer, SW, Long range. Then hightail it back over
to Hobo Dog. It's a pisser. Besides, I used to work at McD's.

East of Hobo Dog are a couple of shops, none of which are very interesting.
There's a Bard's Tale reference in the occult shop. And give up trying to
kill the roaming violinist in the restaurant, it's impossible. I've tried.

Downtown East
-------------
On the north side is a three-legged prostitute. Don't have anything to do
with her, she's diseased.

On the south side is Leroy's, the most important place in Needles. Yes, this
is the gun shop. Plus, you can rest safely in here. You'll be camped out here
for the duration of your stay in Needles, trust me.

East of Leroy's is the Acapulco club, where you can gamble away your money,
if you're so inclined. There is also a superloot bag here, if you really want
to cheat beyond absurdity. It involves winning one game, not taking the loot,
then winning another game at the other side of the table. Dropan item, go
back to the first bag, and hit Down until the loot comes up.

Pick up Christina in the alley between Leroy's and Acapulco. Watch out, she's
a bit trigger-happy (seriously, in the several dozen times I've played the
game, she fires full auto more often than any other NPC).

NW Needles
----------
Don't wander around here, there's lots of radiation. Along the road there's
a gas station, which is where you'll start out if you took the jeep.
But the main attraction here is:

The Temple of Blood
-------------------
Approach this place by night, so you can see the radiation.

The garage is useless. Go in via the south entrance instead. Watch out for
robots, head west, and free the hobo from the torture table. His name is Ralf,
and he's good for carrying stuff. There is a launch code written in an empty
chair in the sanctuary.

Head for the Holy Game room, and play the game. The best way through this is
by trial and error, but I'll tell you this much, the answer to the question
at the is 30.

Lower Level
-----------
Rest up on the dock, then swim across to the island. Kill the snipers in the
corners. By now, all your characters should have automatic weapons. NATOs
are the best. Blow open the door.

JUMP OVER THE PLATE!!!!!!!!!!!! If you do not, then you will be in a world of
shit, because Desert Rangers are not allowed to die without permission! When
you first get inside, have each char fire full auto at an odd-numbered group.
With luck, you'll take out everything in two or three rounds. No other special
strategy here, just plow through everything, and finish off everything in the
outer section before going into the inner room.

The Blood Priest will be inside with the real Bloodstaff. Keep it safe.
Grab as much loot as you can, and head back to the dock.

Missile Interior
----------------
You're inside a giant hollowed-out ICBM. Give the launch code to the guy at
the control panel. Hint: it's NOT Mortar. Exit through the now-open top.

Mushroom Church
---------------
Give the priest the Bloodstaff, and get lots of stuff. You can use the engine
to fix the water cooler back in Highpool, but it's not worth it anymore.

Congrats. Needles is finito.

Ag Center
---------
Try the Ag Center now. It should be easy. Go to the front desk, and offer to
help. Kill Harry the Bunnymaster, and check out the old man's root cellar.
Try the cave if you're in need of target practice.

Las Vegas
---------
Don't bother getting the jeep fixed in Needles, it's a rip and it'll just get
stolen when you get to Vegas.

Las Vegas General Notes
-----------------------
Robots are a bitch. In general, slicerdicers and chopters are easy, Warroids
are annoying, Cyborg Commandoes are dangerous, and Scorpitron is absolutely
unfair. Random attacks get on your nerves after a while.

There's no shop in Vegas, so you'll have to hoof it back to Needles every
once in a while.

First thing you see when you get to Vegas is the library (if you entered
through the bottom right corner of the icon on the Desert map). About three
buildings west on this street is an abandoned building with a bum in it.
Give him some money, and he'll tell you the password to Fat Freddy's Casino.

Talk to Freddy, he'll ask you to kill Faran Brygo. Agree to it.

There's a proton axe in a building near the center of town. You'll know you're
in the right place if you get attacked by insects.

Spade's Casino
--------------
Talk to Crumb, and he'll give you the password to Brygo's place. If you're
feeling especially evil, you can slaughter everyone in the place.

By now, everyone should have a NATO. Sell off all your other guns, now you
can operate with 7.62mm exclusively for a long stretch of the game.

Faran Brygo
-----------
Brygo's place is east of the center of town, where the Scorpitron has taken
up residence. Killing it is a bitch and half. Load up on rockets, split the
party into two groups, and attack it from two sides at once.

Inside Brygo's place, give the passwords, and talk to Brygo. Here you have a
choice. You can talk to Brygo, in which case he sends you to see Charmaine at
the mushroom temple (not to be confused with the mushroom church in Needles).

Or, you can attack him, in which case you can plow through his place, killing
everyone that crosses your path. Check the computer (it's a laugh, isn't it?)
On your way to kill Brygo, stop off at the sauna. Check the walls around. Use
Cryptology, and open his vault. Grab tons of loot. Kill Brygo, grab the ring.

If you choose not to kill Brygo, you can get an onyx ring in the Guardian
Citadel later on (by that time, you won't need to reward money though).

Fat Freddy's
------------
If you have acquired an onyx ring (one way or another), head back to Fat
Freddy's place. He'll double-cross you, so kill him and everyone else around.
No Witnesses.

Prison
------
The prison is in the extreme NE corner of Vegas. Free Covenant, he's a good
fighter. Grab loot in the vault.

The Temple of the Mushroom Cloud
--------------------------------
Open door with TNTs, grab loot. Talk to Charmaine. She'll ask you to get the
Bloodstaff back from the priest in Needles. Bring it back, and she'll open
the door to the sewers for you.

OR...... You could kill her and everyone else in the place, and use a sonic
key to open the secret doors. Whichever you prefer.

Btw, it is not recommended that you sabotage the reactor. It makes it a bitch
to get around the central room later on (but it's good for a laugh). In fact,
almost the entire east side of the place is useless, except for the library,
and the doctor. Additionally, you can pick up Dr. Mike Scott, but he's a
lousy fighter, and you should have stocked up on Doctor skills by now.

The Sewers
----------
The entrance to the sewers is on the left side of the Temple. If you didn't
get Charmaine to open it for you, look for the wall that says it has a funny
slot on it. Go north through the dusty hallway, and down you go.

If you thought that the robots outside were tough, wait till you see what's
waiting for you down here.

Use ropes to cross the river, and the chasm.

There will be several fights that will be totally frustating. Among these are
Tronosaurus, and Centron Deluxe Models. Save often.

There are sections where the walls sound hollow. Use a shovel to dig through.
Macros are useful here.

You can rest safely while in a tunnel, or on a rope.

Clear out the sewers, and collect hardware.
By the time you get to the lab in the second section, you should have at
least:
        1 Andriod Head
        1 Fusion Cell
        1 Power Converter
        2 ROM Boards
        4 Servo Motors

Put Max back together following the instructions, and find out where the
Sleeper Base is.

Darwin Village
--------------
Watch out for bad guys here.

You can give the password for the weapons shop, but it's easier in the long
run to kill the guards. Metal Maniac and Mad Dog Fargo are sick, and lying
in a back room in the tavern. Go to the lab, just west of the tavern. Mix
chemicals with fruits and make antitoxins, and cure them. You can get
chemicals in Ugly's hideout in Quartz, and the Housekeeping shelves in the
Stagecoach Inn. These guys are better fighters than Ace and Christina.

Sleeper One
-----------
The whole purpose of the sewers is to trigger the entrance to the Sleeper
Base. It's up in the corner, north of Darwin.

Sleeper Base, Level 1
---------------------
Look for Secpass 1 in the room to the left. Open the door with a crowbar.
Secpass 3 in one of the cubicles.

Sleeper Base, Level 2
---------------------
Learn skills at the library. Have at least one PC learn Cyborg Tech. Look for
a room with a desk. Search the desk for Secpass A. There are two vaults here,
the left one is the heavy weapons vault, it only opens with Secpass B, then
three LAWs. The one on the right is the main vault, use Secpass 7. 

Now would be a good time to organize a little. Give all the Secpasses to one
PC, and re-order their inventory and put them all at the top. Set macros for
each one, and stop recording before you hit a direction.

Sleeper Base, Level 3
---------------------
Search another desk to find Secpass 7. In this same room, you'll find a
secret door. Disband someone (if possible, someone not so necessary, like an
NPC), and send them up NE, into the power room. Switch back and forth so you
can get the party past the electrified floor. The power has to be on for the
doors to work, and off if you want to keep your dudes from getting fried.
At the end, kill the robots and use Safecracking to open the safe. Grab the
plasma coupler.

Try out the helicopter simulator. The door needs a ROM Board. If no one can
learn it yet, try again later.

Cloning for the Clone-Impaired Made Easy
----------------------------------------
The first step is to learn Clone Tech. Then locate the clone fluid machine
(just south of the heavy weapons vault). If the machine doesn't work, try
fixing the Power Controller (needs a new power converter) in the room in the
NE corner of this level. Use Clone Tech to balance the chemicals, then use a
jug to get the clone fluid. Take it to the clone pods, use it on the pods,
and clone characters one at a time.

Project Darwin
--------------
Open doors with Secpass 7. There's nothing on the first level. Stay away from
the Mars test area, the mutants are tough. Go to the lower level, and free
the prisoners. Then go to the upper level, and kill Finster. Take his head,
use it on the Cyborg Interface machine, and dive in.

Finster's Mind Maze
-------------------
Just keep going through the tests. Don't waste your ammo on the nightmare,
you can't kill it. For the one with the arrows, wander around until you're
in the top left corner. Then use INT on the square you're sitting on, and
eventually you'll hit the bottom left corner, head right. Kill the Lie
Spider, and smash through wals with rockets. For the baseball one, use Luck.
Kill Finster againm and again, and again. For Damned if you Do, Damned if you
Don't, it doesn't matter which one you pick. Use INT on yourself to get out
of it. Kill the Giant Finster, and grab Secpass B.

Guardian Citadel
----------------
Equip yourself with Laser weapons and Pseudo-Chitin Armor, and go after the
Guardians. Note: You can rest anywhere in here.

KILL EVERYONE.

Brother Goliath has a Pulsar Key. The Quasar Key is in the museum. After
killing Brother Austin and safecracking the armory, you should all have
laser rifles or better. In the armory, take everything but one power pack.
Trust me, you'll thank me in the morning.

Outer Sanctum
-------------
Pretty straightforward. Kill everyone, except Redhawk, who is in the prison.
Get a second proton axe here also. Get the Nova Key from a bed on the left
side. The Blackstar Key is hidden in the altar on the right side. Open the
portcullis to get to the next level.

Savage Village
--------------
Pick up Redhawk and take him to the Savage Village. Return him to his father,
and they'll tell you how to get to Base Cochise. While you're there, you can
slaughter everyone, lots of helpless women and children. Drop Redhawk at this
point, and don't give anything to him, he won't ever trade anything back. Not
ever.

Inner Sanctum
-------------
Kill everyone (see a pattern here?), and raid the vault. Power armor is very
nice. You'll find that second Onyx ring in the room on the left side. Break
down the fence to the helicopter with the proton axe.

Get in the helicopter when you're ready to leave (any carry-on luggage,
sirs?). Make sure you take at least one Rad Suit with you, you'll need it.
The helicopter trip is one way only.

Sleeper Two
-----------
It is possible to approach Base Cochise on foot, but I wouldn't recommend
it, at least not the first time. The helicopter takes out most of the
outside defenses. There are two ways in: Use a rocket on a weapons pod, and
a rope to drop down inside, or you can go through the front door.

Whatever you do, don't type BREAK at the computer terminal, it's a trap.

Find the loose panel on either the left or right side, and rocket your way
to the next level.

Base Cochise, Level 2
---------------------
After the bridge, you'll find the cyborg factory. One terminal works, type
RUN, then select Admin. Pick up VAX, he's a great NPC. Best of all, he comes
equipped. Raid the armory at the NE corner of this level, then head back and
find the ladder to level 3.

Base Cochise, Level 3
---------------------
Pretty simple. Just go through the tests.

One: Walk across the pipes.
Two: Use Perception to find the landmines.
Three: Cross the electrified floors and fans.
Four: Kill Everything.

Base Cochise, Level 4
---------------------
Kill the guns in the four corners.

Security Center (SE Room)
-------------------------
Find the Security Interval control, and use Electronics to lower the interval
a couple times.

Robot Maintenance (NE Room)
---------------------------
Watch for the conveyor belt. At the top is some "delicate" equipment. Smash
it.

OSHA Room (SW Room)
-------------------
Kill the Fusion Powered Octoron. Silver Stranglers are cheap.

The Reactor Core (NW Room)
--------------------------
So it begins. Equip one PC with the Blackstar Key and a Rad Suit, disband
him, and head for the reactor room. Smash the glass wall, and use the plasma
coupler to fix the failsafe mechanism. Go to the cubicle in the corner.
Use the Blackstar Key on the console.

Disperse the other three PCs in this manner:

Robot Maintenance (NE Room): Use the Nova Key here.
Security Center (SE Room): Use the Pulsar Key here.
OSHA Room (SW Room): Use the Quasar Key here.

The cubicles will close. Hit Enter to start the self-destruct sequence.

Note: If you get it wrong, just start over with the sequence. What's it gonna
do, blow up on ya?

Hit the buttons in the following order, switching back and forth between the
appropriate rooms:

NW: Red
SE: Yellow
SW: Green
NE: Blue

NOW GET THE HELL OUTTA THERE!!!! Join up with everyone, get into the escape
pod, just north of where you arrived on this level. Head out the front door,
and Full Auto anything that gets in your way.

Afterward
---------
If anyone survives, radio back to base. You'll get a truckload of experience.
Not sure what it's good for tho. There's not going to be a sequel. You can
start the game over with the same dudes, but they lose their money and items.
Have fun...

Super loot bags
---------------
Super loot bags are the result of programming errors and possibly bad
memory management. Pretty weird, considering this was 1985, and they
didn't use any special libraries or do anything at the machine code
level back then. But I digress.

The only place I've tested it is at the Acapulco club in Needles. I've
heard it works at Fat Freddy's as well. Make sure your gambling skill is
decent. Play a hand at one of the chairs, and don't take the loot. Then
go play a hand at the other chair. Take the loot, then immediately drop
an item. Go back to the first bag, and hit PGDN a couple of times.

Now since this is a program error (it truly is a bug, it's not an Easter
Egg), the things listed are not real items, like the regular items are,
(ie: there's no real items called "Name AC", etc.), they're just the
contents of some memory address that was plugged into a pointer at random.
As such, the list tends to be somewhat random. However, you can usually
find Sabot rockets, Proton Axes, and Red Ryders somewhere on the list.

Printing Stats
--------------
If you've ever wanted to print your Ranger statuses straight from the
game to your printer, just hit the "p" key on your keyboard while in
the game. Out from your printer will spew all your Rangers' vital stats,
including skills, attributes, weapons and rank. I think this is a debug
command that the programmers left in by accident.

Required Stuff to Finish the Game
---------------------------------
Las Vegas Sewers (fix Max to find location of Sleeper Base)
Sleeper Base (get Secpasses)
Project Darwin (get Secpass)
Guardian Citadel (Get weapons and Redhawk)*
Savage Village (Find location of Base Cochise by Returning Redhawk)*
Base Cochise (Win)*

If you want to be REALLY technical, the ones marked with a '*' are the only
TRULY necessary ones. The others make the game easier.
