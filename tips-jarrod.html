Okay, here goes:
<p>
<ol>
<li>Once a Proton axe is obtained, give it to your strongest Ranger. When you
go to Chochise, he'll (she'll) reak havoc when the robots attack at close
quarters. Couple this with a decent brawling skill, and that character will
get off 6-7 attacks per turn. I did this with one of my men and he reached
Cadet while the rest of my men were stumbling at Sergeant.
<li>It is imperative that you give everyone Climb, Swim, Brawling, and the
skill for their main weapon (to be determined) 
<li>Clones of NPC's act as NPC's, keep this in mind when cloning
<li>To see the safe in Ugly's hideout, you must stand in front of the map, then
hit ESC  (rest) until you see it. Don't forget the combo!
<li>If you can't beat Finster's mind maze (I only found the BASE my third time
through!), don't despair, there's a Secpass B in the Citadel, and it IS
possible to get it using only Kevlar suits. (of course, once you have access
to the Power Armor near the Secpass, the whole thing becomes moot except for
the power packs and laser rifles within) 
<li>Rangers without water are unhappy Rangers. Have every ranger carry a
canteen.
<li>Use a crowbar (not explosives) on the boxes in the Guardian Museum to get
the Quasar Key.
<li>If anyone has reached Supreme Jerk, let me know at capnj0@aol.com
</ol>
<center>-Enjoy!
