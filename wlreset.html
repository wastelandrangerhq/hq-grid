For those of you who are playing the
<a href="http://www.interplay.com/games/10th.html">Interplay 10 Year
Anthology</a> version of Wasteland, or the version on the CG-ROMs
inside the November 1996 and October 1997
issues of <i>Computer Gaming World Magazine</i>, you may have heard
that you don't have the full version.  You're right.
<p>
The original game
included several setup files, which once installed, loaded on to your
hard drive (or your floppy disks!) the Wasteland game.  One of the options
in the setup process is restarting the game with the same characters.
<p>
In other words, you can win as many times as you want with the same
batch of characters--the setup file can reset the maps <i>only</i> if
you want.  But only if you have the original version.  For some reason,
the deal that <a href="http://www.interplay.com">Interplay</a>
struck with Computer Gaming World magazine did not include the
original version, nor does the 10 Year Anthology have the original
files.  (One source claims Interplay lost the original disks, but
we won't go there....)  If you want to reset the maps, you may be
interested in the following home made reset program.

Jeremy Reaban, the author of this reset program, in an article he
posted to the Usenet news group <a href="news:comp.sys.ibm.pc.games.rpg">
comp.sys.ibm.pc.games.rpg</a>:
<hr width="50%">
As I've posted in the past, I've been working on a program that will reset
the maps in Wasteland so you can play it again with the same characters.
Since no one sent me any of their saved games, I had to play Wasteland
through twice before I was sure it worked. Anyway, it's done. It seems to
work.  If anyone downloaded the early alpha I posted, this version is much
improved.  Now it's only one program, driven by a menu.

<hr width="50%">
Jeremy Reaban no longer has this program at his home page which has
been vaporized.  Thanks to Tim Gray for locating this program for me!
<p>
You may now download his program from the <a href="bin.html">Binaries Databse
</a>of the Wasteland Ranger HQ-Grid.  The file is a PKZip file containing three
files: the executable, a batch driver, and a readme:

<ul>
  <li><a href="bin/jwlreset.zip">jwlreset.zip</a>
</ul>

Enjoy, and many happy adventures....
