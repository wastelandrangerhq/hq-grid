<h3><a name="introduction">INTRODUCTION</a></h3>


The following is an excerpt from The History of the Desert Rangers,
The Early Years, by Karl Allard, 2087, Allard Press, Ranger Center
Hardbound pp. 293, $20 gold.
<br><br>
Tensions grew with the coming of 1998.  The United States' Citadel
Starstation was slated to be fully operational by March, Soviet
charges that the space station was merely a military launching
platform alarmed a number of nonaligned nations.  The right wing
governments in the South and Central Americas, many of them set up by
the U.S. during the Drug Wars (1987-1993), pledged their support to
the U.S.  The NATO nations, including the new African members also
declared their alliance with the U.S.  That move forced most of the
remaining neutral powers to join the Soviet protest.  In six short
weeks, only Switzerland, Sweden, and Ireland continued to declare
themselves neutral nations.
<br><br>
Two weeks before Citadel was due for full operation, the station
transmitted a distress signal.  Immediately after the message was
sent, most of the satellites orbiting the planet were swept clean from
the sky, leaving the great powers blind.  In military panic, each sent
90 percent of their nuclear arsenals skyward.  Although the
destruction was tremendous, it was not complete.  Pockets of
civilization remained, some even oblivi- ous to the military exchange.
<br><br>
On the same day that the U.S. and Soviet Union were attempting to
extinguish each other, a company of U.S. Army Engineers were in the
southwestern deserts building transportation bridges over dry
riverbeds.  They worked deep in the inhospitable desert valleys,
surrounded by a number of survivalist communities.  Located directly
south of their position on that day was a newly-constructed federal
prison.  In addition to housing the nation's criminals condemned to
death, the prison contained light industrial manufacturing 
facilities.
<br><br>
Shortly after the nuclear attack began, the Engineers, seeking
shelter, took over the federal prison and expelled the prisoners into
the desolate desert to complete their sentences.  As the weeks passed,
they invited the nearby survivalist communities to join them and to
help them build a new society.  Because of each communities'
suspicions towards one another, times were difficult at first.  But as
time nurtured trust, this settlement -- which came to be known as
Ranger Center -- grew to be one of the strongest outposts.  Ranger
Center even proved powerful enough to repel the hands of rancorous
criminals who repeatedly attached in attempts to reclaim what was once
``rightfully theirs.''
<br><br>
The citizens of Ranger Center, after first believing that they were
the only ones who survived the nuclear malestrom, soon realized that
communities beyond the desert's grip had also survived, Because they
had such success in constructing a new community, they felt compelled
to help other survivors rebuild and live in peace.
<br><br>
Toward this end, the Desert Rangers, in the great tradition of the
Texas and Arizona Rangers a century before, were born.
<br><br>

<h3><a name="objective">OBJECTIVE</a></h3>

Wasteland is a post-nuclear holocaust adventure.  Your party, the
famed Desert Rangers, have been assigned to investigate a series of
disturbances in the desert.  After several strategy meetings, you've
decided to search for clues in Highpool, the Agricultural Center, and
the Rail Nomads' Camp, all of which are located to the west of Ranger
Center.
<br><br>
The first thing you need to do is read the Command Summary section
(page 46).  It tells you how to get Wasteland up and running on your
computer.  It also contains a summary of the keystroke commands that
you'll be using.  Once you load the game, you'll find a party waiting
by the Ranger Center.
<br><br>

<h3><a name="the party">THE PARTY</a></h3>

A party can have up to seven characters, four of whom you can create.
The four that you can create are called Player Characters (PCs).  The
other three spaces are reserved for Non-Player Characters (NPCs), whom
you'll meet during the course of your adventure (see ``Recruiting
Allies'' for more details on NPCs).  It you don't use all of the four
slots for your player characters, you can fill them with NPCs.
<br><br>
A party of four awaits your command: Hell Razor, Angela Deth,
Thrasher, and Snake Vargas.  This is a well-balanced party quite
capable of seeing you through the entire game.  You can use them or
create your own characters.
<br><br>
There are no special advantages to the characters in the original
party -- no divine insight, no super luck, no outrageous skills.  You
could easily create characters who are just as -- or even more --
effective.  If you prefer to make your own characters, enter the
Ranger Center to do this.  You'll have to delete one or more of the
existing characters to create your own.  But before you wipe out the
existing party, take a look at their profiles first by pressing keys
1-4 to see each one.
<br><br>
At any time during the journey you can view your party roster by
pressing the space bar.
<br><br>

<h3><a name="creating characters">CREATING CHARACTERS</a></h3>

Follow these steps to create a Desert Ranger.
<br><br>
1.	Enter the Ranger Center.  If this is your first time in the game, 
        you're already at the Ranger Center.
<br><br>
2.	If the current party already contains four PCs, press D to delete 
        one and make room for your new character.
<br><br>
3.	Press C to create a character.  At the top of the screen you'll 
        see ``Create a character.''  Below are the character's attributes-- 
        the higher these values are, the better (see ``Attributes and 
        Personal Statistics'' for details).  If you're not satisfied with 
        these values, press the spacebar to ``reroll'' the values.  When 
        you're satisfied, press [RETURN].
<br><br>
4.	Name your character (up to 13 letters).
<br><br>
5.	Choose a sex.
<br><br>
6.	Select a nationality.
<br><br>
7.	Select the skills you want your character to have (see ``Skills'' 
        for complete details).  Press [RETURN] when you're done.  If you
        make a mistake while allocating skills, press [CONTROL]-R to 
        re-allocate them.
<br><br>
8.      Press Y if you want to keep this character.  Press N if you don't
        want to keep him or her.
<br><br>
9.	Press S to leave the Ranger Center and start the game.
<br><br><br><br>
<h3><a name="character profile">CHARACTER PROFILE</a></h3>

To view any character's profile -- personal statistics, possessions,
and skills -- enter the character's roster number.  When you're done
viewing each screen, press the spacebar [RETURN] to go to the next
screen, or [ESC] to return to the previous screen.
<br><br>

<h4><a name="attributes and personal statistics">Attributes and Personal Statistics</a></h4>

The first screen lists your character's attributes and other
miscellaneous personal statistics.
<br><br>
Strength (ST): The ability to overpower enemies or to lift, move, and
break items.  This is important in hand-to-hand combat and in physical
tasks such as breaking down doors.
<br><br>
Intelligence (IQ): How well a character thinks and solves problems.
This is probably the mot important attribute because it determines
which and how many skills a character may master.  Certain skills can
only be master by characters with an IQ of a certain level or above.
Characters start with skill points equal to their IQ.  During the
course of the game, you'll definitely want to raise your IQ.
<br><br>
Luck (LK): Lucky characters tend to find more things and avoid more
damage then unlucky ones.  Luck also improves your odds in
hand-to-hand combat.
<br><br>
Speed (SP):  How quickly you move, which helps you escape tight situations.
<br><br>
Agility (AGL): How deftly you move.  High agility enhances your
acrobatic ability, so you can do things like dodge blows and jump on
tables The higher this value, the better you'll perform in
hand-to-hand combat.
<br><br>
Dexterity (DEX): Ability to master fine movements like picking locks
or aiming weapons.  Dexterity is very important in combat, and
extremely useful in mastering the ``thiefly'' arts.
<br><br>
Charisma (CHR): This attribute lets you know how likeable or
persuasive a character is.  Although it may seem like a trivial
trait. it might well make the difference between life and death as you
try to convince someone that you're trustworthy.  Charisma also
affects how an NPC will react to you when you want to hire him or
trade equipment.
<br><br>
Skill Points (SKP): When you first create a character, this value is
identical to IQ.  The more skill points you have, the more skills you
can learn.  You can acquire more skill points during the game (see
``Skills'' for more details).
<br><br>
Rank: Each character starts out as a private.  As you acquire
experience points, you can radio back to Ranger Center for a field
promotion.  Each time you're promoted, your rank changes, your maximum
constitution goes up by two points, and you get an additional two
points to invest in any attribute.  Rank does not affect how orders
are given or taken since your characters are equal member of a team.
A high rank, however could impress civilians enough so you can get
into places where regular folks can't go.
<br><br>
Maximum Constitution (MAXCON): The higher this is, the more of a
beating you can take before you die.  This value is the same as MAX on
the onscreen statistics.
<br><br>
$:  The total cash this character is carrying.
<br><br>
Sex:  Sex only affects what bathroom he or she has access to
<br><br>
Nationality:  Choose from U.S., Russian, Mexican, Indian, or Chinese.
<br><br>
P)ool: Press P to command all the party members to pool their cash and
give it to this character.
<br><br>
D)iv cash: Press D to have this character evenly distribute his cash
among all the party members.  If you have disbanded into several
groups, only those in the same group as the character who is dividing
his cash will share in the wealth.
<br><br>

<h3><a name="items">ITEMS</a></h3>

The second screen lists what items your character owns.  You can carry
up to 30 items that you find or buy during your travels.  Don't
immediately toss away items that seem useless.  It can actually be an
important fragment from a greater, more powerful item.  Many items can
be sold for cash at various stores.
<br><br>
A precaution about picking up items: once you pick something up, you
have to keep it or drop it.  If you drop it, it will vanish into the
depths of Wasteland, never to be seen again.  If you have no intention
of picking up an item to keep (maybe because you're already carrying
the maximum amount and you don't want to drop anything) you should
leave it where it is.  That way, you can come back for it later (and
you better remember too, or you may miss out on some loot hidden
beneath the item.)
<br><br>
To give or show something to someone who is not a party member, use
the item on the space that you're on by pressing the spacebar.
<br><br>
Press the number that represents the item you'd like to use, and
you'll get the following choices:
<br><br>
Reload: If you select an ammo clip that fits your currently-equipped
weapon, you're asked it you want to Reload.
<br><br>
Unjam: If you choose a jammed weapon, you'll be asked if you want to
unjam it.  If you successfully unjam the weapon, you'll lose the clip
that was in it, leaving you with an unloaded weapon.  Don't forget to
reload before you're ambushed by a bunch of bikers.
<br><br>
Drop: Drop removes something from your list forever.  You'll probably
only use this command if you're carrying a full load, and need to drop
something in order to pick up another item.  You can also use this
command to drop something that's broken (but keep in mind that broken
items can be repaired or sold).
<br><br>
Trade: Trade lets you give items to another character.  Enter the
number of the intended recipient and the trade will be made.  NPCs
have a mind of their own and may not always want to give their items
away.
<br><br>
unEquip: To equip an item so it's ready to use, press E.  If you use
this while you're already equipped, the chosen item will replace the
previously-equipped item.  You can only have one type of armor and one
type of weapon equipped at any given time.  The weapon you equip shows
up in the onscreen statistics below WEAPON.  When a piece of armor is
properly equipped, your armor class reflects the change.
<br><br>

<h3><a name="skills">Skills</a></h3>

The third screen shows this character's skills and skill levels.  The
skills you posses weigh heavily in your success.  Each character
should have a slightly different repertoire, so the whole party
benefits from a greater variety of skills.  One character could
specialize in gambling, lockpicking and forgery, while another could
excel in demolition, brawling, and climbing.
<br><br>
Medical skills are something that more than one character should
possess.  All the skills in the world don't amount to anything if a
character's flat on his back, too weak to use them.  The more
characters who possess medical savvy, the safer the party is.
<br><br>
Since you must have a minimum IQ to be able to learn certain skills,
the higher you IQ, the more skills you get to choose from.  You simply
can't learn the more technical skills if you're not smart enough.
<br><br>
LVL: The level of your skill.  The higher this is, the better you are.
You can invest skill points in any skill as many times as you like,
each time you invest in a skill, the skill level goes up Skills also
improve as you use them.  Since the cost of each successive skill
level rises dramatically, improving a skill by using it is a cheap,
effective method of gaining skill levels.
<br><br>
NOTE: When creating a character or when visiting a library, you'll see
the total available skill points at the top of the screen.  (Your
skill point value is the same as your initial IQ value).  To select a
skill, enter its number.  If you make an error, you can start your
selecting over again by pressing [CONTROL]R.  Press [ESC] to exit this
character profile entirely.
<br><br>
IQ:  The minimum IQ you must have to use this skill.
<br><br>
PTS: How many skill points it will cost to acquire this skill.
Initially, you can select a skill more than once; in fact, this is how
you become more adept (or advance in levels) at this skill.  Once you
select a skill, the point cost doubles as each successive skill level
becomes more costly.
<br><br>
Don't be stingy with your skill points when you're creating your
characters.  You'll have the chance to acquire more skill points as
you move up in the ranks (see ``Getting Promoted'' for details on how
you can accumulate skill points).  You can save a few, if you'd like,
since there are several special places outside of the Ranger Center
where you can learn more skills.  But keep in mind that picking skills
at the Ranger Center is a one-shot deal; once you leave, you can't
come back to pick more.
<br><br>
Below are descriptions of the skills grouped according to their
minimum IQ requirement.  After each skill name is a number in
parentheses; this is the number of skill points needed to buy the
first level for that skill.  Each successive level doubles in cost.

<br><br>
<h4>IQ 3</h4>

Brawling (1): Any fighter who can wander through a full-fledged bar
fight without getting much more than a scratch is either very lucky or
highly skilled in brawling.  The higher your skill in brawling, the
more attacks you get per round in hand-to-hand combat.
<br><br>
Climb (1): Gives you the ability to climb over fences, up sheer cliff
faces, and out of pits.
<br><br>
Clip Pistol (1): A must-have skill since your initial weapon issue
will be either the M1911A1 .45 caliber or a VP91Z 9 mm automatic clip
pistol.  Without this skill, you won't be very accurate with the
weapon or have much luck fixing it if it breaks.
<br><br>
Knife Fighting (1): When fighting with knives, this give an advantage
to a skilled fighter over an unskilled one.
<br><br>
Pugilism (1): One of the oldest forms of fighting, it teaches you how
to dish out punches as well as avoid them.  Handy for those close-up
battles where the fists start flying.
<br><br>
Rifle (1): A good basic skill to have since many of the weapons sold
by raiders are serviceable M19 rifles.  You'll rue the day you didn't
pick up this skill as you look helplessly at the rifle you can't shoot
accurately.
<br><br>
Swim (1): The desert sands don't blanket the entire earth.  This will
come in hand in those spots where you have to swim.
<br><br>

<h4>IQ 6</h4>

Knife Throwing (1): A tricky skill that comes in handy when fighting
gets heavy.  You use up all your ammo and resort to throwing knives.
<br><br>
Perception (1): Helps the character find concealed items and notice
when things are out of the ordinary.  No one should be without it.
<br><br>

<h4>IQ 9</h4>

Assault Rifle (1): If you're using an AK-97 or M1089A1 assault rifle,
this skill helps you fire, load, and unjam it quickly.  A skill that
ranks up there in importance with walking and breathing.
<br><br>
AT Weapon (1): Helps you recognize and use anti-tank weapons like LAW
rockets.  A handy skill to have should you encounter something far
tougher than your Ranger instructors ever told you about.
<br><br>
SMG (1): Lets a character control basic submachine guns like the Uzi
or Mac 17.  May make a big difference when you're outnumbered three to
one by bandits who've decided that they want the gold from your teeth.
<br><br>

<h4>IQ 10</h4>
<br><br>
Acrobat (1): This skill for the agile can get you out of a tough
situation -- like leaping off of bar counters while you're surrounded
by a hostile crowd.
<br><br>
Gamble (1): The skill that built Vegas, you'll do well in all games of
chance, and you'll; also be able to spot a crooked game from a mile
away.
<br><br>
Picklock (1): This can get you into places where you want to go, but
where other don't want you to go.,
<br><br>
Silent Movement (1): This helps you move unnoticed past a guard post;
making it tough for enemies to catch up with you.
<br><br>

<h4>IQ 11</h4>

Confidence (1): For an already charismatic person, good confidence can
enable one to talk to a miser out of his fortune.  It's particularly
useful for getting information from people who are suspicious of you.
<br><br>

<h4>IQ 12</h4>


Sleight of Hand (1): A thieving skill that lets you perform
sleight-of-hand tricks -- perfect when you need to amaze those you
meet.
<br><br>

<h4>IQ 13</h4>

Demolition (1): Teaches you how much of an explosive substance you can
use without blowing yourself up.
<br><br>
Forgery (1): Helps you recognize or create a forged document.  Someday
you my just need to whip up a security pass to get by some vigilant
guards.
<br><br>

<h4>IQ 14</h4>

Alarm Disarm (1): Trains you to recognize and disable alarms.  If you
want to get into a place without getting caught, this a good skill to
have.
<br><br>
Bureaucracy (1): Even though most of civilization ended with the bomb,
an inordinate number of petty bureaucrats managed to survive.  This
helps you deal with them so you can get when you want.

<br><br>
<h4>IQ 15</h4>

Bomb Disarm (2):  Allows you to defuse most explosive devices.
<br><br>
Medic (2): A vital skill that lets a character stabilize a
badly-wounded comrade so he or she has a chance to recover.
<br><br>
Safecrack (2): An experience practitioner of this art can open safes
sealed even before the holocaust.
<br><br>

<h4>IQ 16</h4>

Cryptology (2): Gives you the talent to encode and decode messages.
Useful in helping you determine what a password might be.
<br><br>

<h4>IQ 17</h4>

Metallurgy (2): Increases your ability to spot, identify, and work
with some basic metals.
<br><br>
To reorder your skills, view them and press <CONTROL>R.  Enter the
number of he skill that you want at the top of the list, the skill
that you want second, and so on until you've selected all the skills.
The new list won't appear until you've selected all the skills.
<br><br>

<h3><a name="onscreen statistics">Onscreen Statistics</a></h3>

In addition to the information that you can call up by entering the
character's number, the following character statistics are always
displayed on the party roster.
<br><br>
	Armor class (AC): The level of protection a character has
against weapons, physical attack, and other forms of damage.  The
higher the armor class, the better.
<br><br>
	Ammunition (AMM): The amount of ammunition you have left in
you equipped weapon.  When it's down to zero, it's time to reload.
Reloading takes a full combat round, so establish a healthy habit of
reloading after each battle.
<br><br>
	Maximum Constitution (MAX): The maximum ``health'' points that
your character can have (see ``Constitution'' below for more details).
This is the same as MAXCON.  If this number is highlighted, then your
character has picked up a life-threatening illness. like radiation
poisoning.  This illness won't go away with the passing of time, so
get this character medical help as soon as you can.
<br><br>
	Constitution (CON): This shows the character's current
condition.  Compare this value to MAX to determine your character's
relative health.  The closer this value is to MAX, the closer your
character is to full strength.  When CON drops below 1, the character
becomes UNConscious.  If the character's condition becomes SERious,
constitution continues to drop and the character will die unless he
get medical assistance soon.
<br><br>
	Weapon: This shows the weapon that your character is currently
armed with.  FIST means the character is unarmed.
<br><br>

<h3><a name="getting promoted">Getting Promoted</a></h3>

You're awarded experience points each time you accomplish a difficult
task or win a difficult battle.  When you think you're accumulated
enough experience points to warrant a promotion, you should radio back
to Ranger Center to have your instructors review your accomplishments.
Since it doesn't cost you anything to radio in, you can do it as often
as you like.  If you've progressed enough (and only your instructors
know when this is), you're given a field promotion.
<br><br>
As a promotion reward, two points are automatically added to your
maximum constitution (MAX, MAXCON).  You're also awarded an additional
two points that you can add to any attribute your choose Put both
points on the same attribute or put one point on two separate
attributes.  If you'd like, add them to maximum constitution to boost
that value even higher.
<br><br>
If you wish to use these two points to acquire a new skill, you must
apply them to IQ.  Remember, IQ points translate into skill points.
If you don't increase your skill points via IQ points, you won't be
able to add new skills.
<br><br>

<h3><a name="recruiting allies">Recruiting Allies</a></h3>

Wasteland is populated with people who have, like you, survived the
nuclear holocaust.  From time to time you'll run into non-player
characters (NPCs) whom you can hire.  You may wish to enlist their
services to add skill, strength, or intelligence to your party.  Refer
to the Encounter command below on how to hire an NPC
<br><br>
NPCs are not robots who obey your every command.  They don't always do
as told in combat.  They don't always trade something when you ask
them to.  While you may not like their autonomy, and think that
they're more trouble than they're worth, remember that they may be
able to get you things that you can't get for yourself or get you into
places where you can't normally go.
<br><br>
To dismiss an NPC, use the disband command.
<br><br>

<h3><a name="commands">Commands</a></h3>

During normal play, a menu of commands are listed across the button of
the screen:
<br><br>
	Use: This lets a character use an Item, Skill, or Attribute to
accomplish a task.  Enter a character number and select an Item, Skill
or Attribute.  Then, enter a direction in which the character will use
the Item, Skill, or Attribute (press the spacebar if you want to use
something right where you're standing).  Certain skills offer
additional prompts.  For example, when you use a medical skill, you
will be asked which character you want to heal.
<br><br>
After you use something you may get the message ``That doesn't seem to
work.''  This suggests that this particular item or method doesn't
work, but that another might.  Also, if you use a skill or attribute
and it doesn't seem to work -- but you're really sure it should --
keep trying.  Sometimes persistence pays off.
<br><br>
	Enc: Encounter calls up the same commands that are available
to the party during combat.  You may want to use Encounter to attract
someone's attention, so you can get information or try to hire them.
<br><br>
You can also use this command as a short cut to perform certain
actions on several characters..  For instance, you could have a couple
characters reload, while another uses an item.  In this case, using
Encounter would be faster than calling up each character individually.
<br><br>
	Order: This changes the marching order of your party.  There
are times when you'll want to change the order to maximize your
party's talents.  For instance, if you're travelling through a
dangerous area, a character with high perception or silent movement
would make an excellent point man.  In another situation, a character
carrying an item that could forestall an attack should be in the lead.
<br><br>
NOTE: When you select Order, you're shown the current marching order.
Select the number of the character you want in front, then second,
then third, and so on until the whole party has been reordered.  Being
placed in the back of the ranks does not shield a character from
combat.
<br><br>
	Disband: Disband lets you break your party into separate,
smaller parties (up to four).  This enables each party to travel
independently of the other parties.  The parties can be spread apart
as far as you'd like.  Disband also offers many tactical advantages in
combat.
<br><br>
Disband has a number of important uses.  If you have dead party
members, use disband to bury them.  You could also use disband when
you're under attack; one person could split off to distract the
attackers.  Some places can only be passed through by one character at
a time, so each person will have to split off into their own party.
<br><br>
CAUTION: Before you can disband NPCs, you're asked if you want them
permanently dis- missed.  If you answer ``yes,'' then they are gone
forever -- you'll never , ever see them again.  If you want them
disbanded -- and not dismissed -- answer ``no.''
<br><br>
When you select Disband, enter the numbers for those
characters who wish to split off from the main party, and press
[RETURN].  Next, indicate the direction that the disbanded party will
move.  Use View to shift control between parties.
<br><br>
To reunite separate parties into a single band, move them onto the
same spot and they will auto- matically regroup.
<br><br>
	View: View lets you shift control between parties.  If you
have more than two parties, and you're not in control of the party you
want, keep entering V until you reach the right one.  If the party is
on another map, you're asked to confirm if you want to shift to them.
<br><br>
	Save: Saves the game. Use this command anytime you find
something you don't want to lose.  Even before the great nuclear war,
computers were known to shut down at inopportune moments.  See the
Command Summary section for more important details on the Save
command.
<br><br>
	Radio: Contacts your instructors at Ranger Center so they can
evaluate your performance.  If you're done well, you're given a field
promotion.  When you select Radio, you're asked to con- firm your
choice.  If you choose to continue, all your characters are evaluated
at the same time and are apprised of any changes in rank.  Because a
Ranger once slept through his promotion, the instructors now require
that all characters be conscious for this procedure; consequently, any
injured, unconscious Rangers will be passed over.  Promoted characters
get a chance to modify attributes at this point (see ``Getting
Promoted'' for more details).
<br><br>

<h3><a name="combat">Combat</a></h3>

Often, when somebody or something comes into your range, you will
enter the Encounter mode.  An encounter is frequently the precursor to
a fight.  Your party roster and a text window will appear.  The text
window will contain a short description of the encounter; press
[RETURN] when you're done reading it.  (If you want to temporarily
remove the party roster and text window to see where the encounter is
located, press the spacebar.  To return to the party roster and text
window, press any key.)
<br><br>
Your options during an encounter are:
<br><br>
	Run: This lets the entire party or a single character run
towards or away from an encounter.  Enter the direction that you want
the party or character to move.  If a single character successfully
runs away, the he's disbanded from the party (This is impossible if
there are four separate parties already).
<br><br>
	Use: This lets a character use an Item, Skill or Attribute to
accomplish a task.  Depending on which you choose a list will appear.
You're then asked to enter a direction in which the Item, Skill, or
Attribute will be executed.
<br><br>
	Hire: Not everybody you meet has turned hostile under the hot
desert sun.  Some are quite pleasant, and may even offer you valuable
services.  If you meet an NPC that you would like to try to hire,
enter the number of the desired recruit.
<br><br>
	Evade: This makes you much harder to hit in combat.  Use this
command when your comrades initiate a firefight, and you don't have a
missile weapon, or when you're injured and wish to minimize the risk
of further physical abuse.
<br><br>
	Attack: In the battle-ridden wastelands, this is a command
you'll often use.  When you select it, you're given a choice of
targets.  If your weapon is an automatic weapon capable of selective
fire, your're asked if you want to fire Single, Burst or Autofire.  If
the encounter is at an extended range, and you have no missile
weapons, you're told that there are no attackers within your range.
If there's only one group of attackers, they're targeted
automatically.
<br><br>
	Weapon: Lets you ready a new weapon, which is useful when your
gun jams in the heat of the battle and you don't want to fix it.  Or,
once you assess the current battle situation, you may want to use a
weapon that's more effective.
<br><br>
	Load/unjam: Loads or unjams a weapon.  This command takes a
full combat round, so it's a good idea to keep your weapon loaded at
all times, otherwise you'll have to reload in the first round of a
firefight.  (You can load or unjam at any time by selecting Enc from
the Main Menu, or by choosing the weapon or appropriate ammo.)  When a
weapon jams, you lose the ammo that was in the weapon at the time.
Unjamming a weapon during combat automatically reloads it.
<br><br>
Press [ESC] if you wish to return to a previous character's options.
Once you've made all your combat selections you're asked if you want
to execute the commands you chose.  Press N to abandon your choices
and start the procedure over again.  Press Y if you're satisfied.
You'll then see a rundown on the effects of the encounter in the text
window.  Use [CONTROL]K or the up arrow to speed up text scrolling.
Use [CONTROL]J or the down arrow to slow down text scrolling.
<br><br>
Since parties can disband and more to different maps, there will be
times when one party is locked in combat while another party is on an
entirely different map.  In these instances, the game asks if you want
the other parties to enter into an encounter.  If you answer ``yes,''
you'll get one combat round for each dis- banded party.  This is a
slow and time consuming process, so you should only run combats on
multiple maps in emergencies.  If you decline the invitation to have
combat on multiple maps, the party you are currently viewing will
execute their combat round before you can view the other parties.
<br><br>

<h4><a name="hand-to-hand combat">Hand-to-Hand Combat</a></h4>

Because the Rangers are trained soldiers, they have an advantage over
the citizens in hand-to-hand combat.  In general, hand-to-hand combat
is not as deadly as a firefight, but you can still easily die from a
good throttling or from a dead-on punch.  Hand-to-hand combat can only
take place at a distance of 14 feet or less.
<br><br>

<h4><a name="missile weapon combat">Missile Weapon Combat</a></h4>

Missile weapon combat is combat that takes place with weapons capable
of range fire.  From guns to grenades, there are numerous missile
weapons at your disposal.  Area-effect weapons, like TNT, plastic
explosives, and grenades, are auto-loading, which means that each time
you use one, you automatically get another until your supply runs out,
so you won't be unarmed in the middle of a fight.  Anti-tank weapons
such as LAW rockets must be re-equipped after firing Automatic weapons
-- assault rifles and submachine guns -- can shoot Single, Burst, or
Autofire.  All guns are clip fed and come in .45, 9mm, or 7.62mm
calibers.  Always carry the proper ammo unless you want to pistol-whip
your enemies.
<br><br>
Keep in mind that all missile combat is simultaneous.  Sure, it's
exciting when you burn a clip of AK-97 ammo into an onrushing horde of
mutant bikers, but your excitement may diminish somewhat when you find
that the mutants are returning fire with equal fervor.  You shoot,
they shoot.
<br><br>

<h4><a name="selective fire">Selective Fire</a></h4>

Single, Burst and Autofire have different effects.  Single uses one
bullet per round, which is great if you're low on ammo, but not so
great if you need to hit your target with the first shot.  Burst
consumes three bul- lets per round and gives the shooter a slight
advantage in hitting and killing his target.  Autofire uses up all the
bullets in the clip, which greatly increases the chance of hitting a
particular target and others in close proximity.  A good choice if you
really need to kill somebody, but not so good if you're looking at
your last clip.
<br><br>

<h4><a name="explosives">Explosives</a></h4>

If you want to do a great deal of damage over a wide area, go with
explosives.  You get more impact per target area, which can be a
lifesaver when being eyed hungrily by a pack of nuke pooches.
Remember, ammo doesn't rain from the heavens.  Running your gun on
full auto all the time may kill the bad guns in a hurry, but you're
likely to run out of ammo just as the last nuke pooch lunges for your
throat.
<br><br>

<h3><a name="weapons list">WEAPONS LIST</a></h3>

Missile weapons come in three range categories : short, medium, and
long.  You'll find that using a clip pistol to hit a target 80 feet
away is not too effective.  Be sure to choose the appropriate weapon
for the appropriate distance.  Here are some of the more common
weapons and their characteristics.
<br><br>

<h4><a name="long range weapons">Long Range Weapons</a></h4>

AK-97 Assault Rifle: Created in the image of the legendary AK-47, the
AK-97 is the latest in the assault rifle line.  It was created for the
Comintern Combine nations of Europe and Africa, but saw large
distribu- tion throughout the world before the war.  It is chambered
for 7.62mm ammo and fires from a 30-bullet clip.  This
highly-respected weapon is fairly commonplace.
<br><br>
M1989A1 NATO Assault Rifle: The M1989A1 is big brother to the original
M16A1.  It was rechambered to accept the same 7.62mm ammo that the AK
series of rifles uses so troops could use captured Soviet ammo.
Although assault rifle users greatly preferred the American ammo for
its damage capabilities, the military implemented this change in
anticipation of front-line ammo shortages.  With this arrangement, a
solider could kill an enemy and replenish his supply at the same time.
<br><br>
M19 Rifle: The M19 rifle is a single-shot weapon firing an 8-shot clip
of 7.62mm ammo.  When rumors of a Soviet invasion of the U.S. spread
through the states, survivalists demanded a weapon that could use
Soviet ammo (necessary, said the survivalists, if Americans were to be
able to use captured ammo).  The invasion never took place, but the
M19 remains a high-profile weapon.  Although it can't fire more than
one bullet at a time, it does have greater range than pistols.
<br><br>
M17 Carbine: The M17 Carbine is a lighter, short-barreled version of
the M19 rifle.  Its 10-shot clip of 7.62mm ammo gives it a faster fire
rate than its big brother, but the barrel length makes it slightly
less accurate at a maximum range.
<br><br>
LAW Rocket: The LAW rocket is a small, armor-piercing explosive rocket
contained in a disposable firing tube.  It was first developed to
destroy tanks.  The mass of the tip (made from depleted uranium)
enables the rocket to blast through the armor so the explosive shell
can burst, once inside.  Some knowl- edge or skill in anti-tank
weaponry is useful when employing rocket.
<br><br>

<h4><a name="medium range weapons">Medium Range Weapons</a></h4>

MAC 17 SMG: The Mac 17 is the sturdiest of the compact submachine guns
developed in the early 1990s.  It shoots .45 Caliber slugs from a
30-shot clip and is known for its man-stopping capabilities.  This
small weapon is well-suited for close-up firefights.
<br><br>
UZI 27 SMG: The Uzi comes from the highly-skilled gunsmiths of
Trans-Palestine.  Its magazine holds 40 9mm bullets and is capable of
burning a full clip in five seconds.  This weapon was built
specifically for fighting terrorists has has proven very effective on
mutant bikers or religious fanatics.
<br><br>

<h4><a name="short range weapons">Short Range Weapons</a></h4>

1911A1 .45 Pistol: The 1911A1 was the standard sidearm of the previous
two world wars.  The .45 slug, held in an 8-shot clip, was first
developed to stop Moro rebels in the Phillipines.  In its current
role, it has no trouble slowing down desert raiders or the occasional
mutant cactus.  Many Desert Rangers find this a perfect weapon to take
with them when they first head into the wastelands.
<br><br>
VP91Z 9mm Pistol: As well liked as the .45 pistol by Desert Rangers,
the VP91Z is a variation on the West German design, featuring an
18-shot capacity of this weapon reduces the need to reload, making it
ideal for extended firefights.
<br><br>
Grenades: Grenades are small, hand-tossed explosive devices useful for
inflicting damage on an entire group of foes at one time.  Grenades
have a wide area of effect, so be sure your character has a good
throwing arm!
<br><br>

<h3><a name="injuries and death">INJURIES AND DEATH</a></h3>

Death is permanent.  If your characters get seriously injured, get
them medical attention quickly or kiss them goodbye.
<br><br>
If a character is lightly wounded, they've taken a few hits, but are
still awake and functional.  A few points have been knocked off his
constitution.
<br><br>
Characters become unconscious when their constitution dips below 1.
While unconscious, they are unable to move.  Over time, an unconscious
character will regain consciousness and heal to full health.  An
alternative to waiting is to find a hospital and pay for a quick heal.
<br><br>
Seriously-wounded characters are in a whole different class of medical
trouble.  Like unconscious characters, whey can do nothing, but unlike
unconscious characters, they don't heal with time -- they worsen.
Without medical help, seriously-wounded characters deteriorate to
critical, to mortal, to comatose, and then to dead.  Another character
with medical skills may be able to stabilize the wounded character
enough so he can improve to the unconsciousness category.  If this
happens, the character will recover with time.
<br><br>
Remember that time waits for no one.  Disbanding one character and
sending him off across the desert to find a doctor will not freeze
time for a seriously-wounded character.  When that character finally
returns with a doctor, they may be back in time to bury the body.
(This is why your party should contain some- body -- preferably two --
with medical skills.)  Should the worst happen, you can bury a dead
character by using the Disband command.
<br><br>

<h3><a name="time and distance">TIME AND DISTANCE</a></h3>

The maps in Wasteland vary in scale.  The large desert map contains
the various city maps, which, in turn, contain building maps or whole
underground levels of sewers and hideouts.  In combat, distances may
seem a bit off for the map you're on, but these are tactical distances
and are valid in combat only.
<br><br>
Because of the difference in scale of the maps, time passes
differently on them.  Though a single keystroke on the computer will
move you one space north in both the desert and in a building, the
amount of time that each move takes is different.
<br><br>
If you want time to pass without moving, press [ESC].
<br><br>

<h3><a name="special places">SPECIAL PLACES</a></h3>

You begin your adventure in the desert along the California-Arizona
border.  The area you'll cover extends from the Ranger Center in the
south up to the Grand Canyon in the north.  The towns of Quartz,
Needles and Las Vegas are three places you'll surely want to visit.
<br><br>

<h4><a name="little old quartz">Little Old Quartz</a></h4>

Quartz is a small town that suffered extensive damage from the nuclear
attacks, yet managed to survive.  Although located far from the large
military targets, this tiny community was affected by earthquakes and
low-level nuclear fallout.  But in its feisty, small town way, Quartz
quickly resumed normal life.  About the only trouble Quartz has these
days is with bandits.
<br><br>

<h4><a name="xenophobic needles">Xenophobic Needles</a></h4>

Needles is bigger than Quartz.  Aside from the flood that resulted
when Hoover Dam was hit, life has not changed much in Needles.
Needles is big enough to defend itself from roving bandits.  However,
it has become home to a couple of odd cults.  The folks in Needles
don't really like strangers that much, but they've welcomed Desert
Rangers in the past and are always willing to trade goods with them.
<br><br>

<h4><a name="lovely vegas">Lovely Vegas</a></h4>

Vegas is the city of Las Vegas.  No one is quite sure how the Soviet
missiles managed to miss the city, but most folks figure it was
because the ``house'' was betting against a missile landing -- and no
one wins against the house.  There was an international rumor about
some Russian general's markers being torn up after the attack, but
that has yet to be confirmed.
<br><br>
Undaunted by its brush with perdition, Vegas is still open for
business and does very well for itself.  The city is large enough to
avoid conquest, and many elements of the desert rabble have even found
gainful employment as enforcers or casino employees.  Despite the
relative success of the city, however, there are dark rumors about
horrors descending from the north to taking up residence in the city
sewers.  All may not be extremely well in the jewel of the Desert.
<br><br>

<h4><a name="deadly deserts">Deadly Deserts</a></h4>

The desert is just as formidable as it was before the holocaust.  In
addition to the lack of water and the fierce heat, there are reports
of radiation zones that have melted the flesh of unwary travellers.
Along with the irradiated human element -- left-over biker gangs,
rabid survivalists, crazed religious zealots -- all sorts of mutant
animals make their home in the desert.  Some say that travelling in
the desert nowadays without an experienced guide is plain suicidal.
<br><br>

<h3><a name="command summary">COMMAND SUMMARY</a></h3>


<h4>Game Play</h4>

IMPORTANT: Wasteland is a dynamic game and it's very important that
you understand how it saves and keeps track of the time.  The game
changes as you play and updates changes to the disk permanently.  If
you take an item, it won't be resurrected just because you leave and
return.
<br><br>
The game takes place in many locations.  As you explore, you'll often
be asked ``Enter New Location (Y/N)?''  If you answer ``yes'' the game
will save any changes to that location, your party's status, and
become your new saved game locations.  If you switch to another
location to view a disbanded party, the status's of all parties are
saved.  You should save the game before ending each session of play.
Then when you go to play again you can pick u where you left off.
However, if your computer will search for the last place it saved.
This way, you're unlikely to lose any important recent acquisitions.
What can you do if a character dies?  DO NOT ENTER A NEW LOCATION OR
SAVE THE GAME!  Turn off your computer and reboot, and your character
will live again, but without anything they acquired since you last
saved.  If all the characters die in the midst of general carnage and
mayhem, your computer will state the obvious: ``Your life in Wasteland
is over.''  Don't get depressed, just reboot and the game will return
your characters to either the last time you saved or the last time the
game map changed.  (This assumes, of course, that three's someplace to
return to.)
<br><br>

<h4>Time and Distance</h4>

Wasteland's maps vary in scale.  The desert map contains the city maps
which in turn contain maps of buildings and underground locations.  In
combat, distances may seem a bit off for the map you're on, but these
are tactical distances valid for combat only.
<br><br>
Because the maps differ in scale, time passes differently on them.  A
single keystroke will move you one space in both the desert and in a
building, but the amount of time each move takes is different.  Time
passes more quickly during overland travel, which the game takes into
account for healing and deteriora- tion purposes.  And remember that
time passes for both the main party and disbanded characters.  If you
send a disbanded character off to find a doctor for an injured
comrade, that comrade will keep on bleeding.
<br><br>
If you want time to pass without moving your party, press <ESC> or
place the mouse icon directly on your party and press the mouse
button.  If you wish time to pass more quickly, hold down the <ESC>
key or keep the mouse button depressed.

<br><br>
<h4>Reviewing Messages</h4>

Wasteland involves a great deal of text.  This text includes
descriptions of your surroundings, descriptions of non-player
characters, clues and references to the Wasteland paragraph section
included in this manual.  If you wish to refer back to or review a
previous message, press the Pg Up key and keep it depressed until the
desired message appears.  To return to the most recent message, press
the Pg Down key and keep it depressed until that message reappears.
<br><br>

<h4>Selecting Options</h4>

Whenever you need to select an option, press the first letter in that
option (unEquip if the exception; in this case press E) or click on it
with your mouse.
<br><br>
Whenever you need to select an item, skill or attribute from a list,
press its number or click on it with your mouse.  To scroll through a
list use the up and down arrows, the right or left arrow, the I key to
scroll up or the K key to scroll down, or use the mouse to click on
the next option or click on the up or down arrows on the right side of
the option window.
<br><br>

<h4>Movement Commands</h4>

There are three ways to move your party: Use the cursor keys, the
mouse, or type I to move up, J to move left, K to move down or L to
more right.  When you use a mouse, a directional arrow will appear on
the screen pointing forward, left, right or backward.  Move the mouse
in the direction you want to go until the directional arrow points in
that direction.  Then hold down the mouse button to more in that
direction.  The Spacebar toggles the view of the party roster on and
off.
<br><br>

<h4>Non-Combat Commands</h4>

Except during combat, you can use the following commands by pressing
the first letter of the command or clicking on it with your mouse.
<br><br>
Use: Use a skill, item or attribute.
<br><br>
Enc:	Simulate an Encounter.  This calls up combat commands, which you 
                                can use to initiate combat or use the Hire 
                                command to hire a non-player character 
                                into your party.
<br><br>
Order: Establish a new party marching Order.
<br><br>
Disband: Disband the party into two or more groups.  This command can also 
                                                    be used to permanently 
                                                    dismiss a Non-Player 
                                                    Character from your party.
<br><br>
View: Alternate the View between two or more groups.
<br><br>
Save: Save the game.   When you use the Save command, the computer will 
                         ask ``Save Game(Y/N)?''  If you answer ``yes'' 
                         the computer will save the game at that point and 
                         ask ``Quite Game (Y/N)?''  If you answer ``yes'' 
                         the computer will return you to the DOS screen 
                         and if you answer ``no'' the computer will 
                         continue the game.  If you answer ``no'' to 
                         ``Save Game(Y/N)?'' the computer will still ask 
                         ``Quit Game(Y/N?)''  If you answer ``no'' the 
                         computer will continue the game.  If you answer 
                         ``yes'' the computer will return you to the DOS 
                         screen, and the next time you reboot the game, 
                         it will start at the last point you saved.
<br><br>
Radio: Radio Ranger Center to see if any party members have earned promotion.
<br><br>
Print: Prints party information when the roster is displayed.
<br><br>
[SHIFT]-#: Call up the Use command for a specific character.

                those menus are displayed.
<br><br>
PgUp & Pg Dn: Scrolls through the messages at the bottom of the screen.

<br><br>
<h4>Combat Commands</h4>

Note: Some weapons have a limited range in combat situations.  Contact
weapons, such as knives, axes, fists, etc., are ineffective against
opponents more than 14 feet away.  Attacking opponents more than 14
feet away requires projectile weapons, such as throwing knives,
pistols, rifles, etc.
<br><br>

<h4>Macro Functions</h4>

Macro functions condense the several key strokes needed to give
certain commands into one key stroke.  To create a macro function,
press [control] and any one of the function keys, F1 to F10,
simultaneously.  A message, REC.MAC. (with a number from 01 to 10
corresponding to the number of the function key you are pressing),
will appear in the upper left corner of the screen; when it does,
release the [control] and the function key again, the message in the
upper left corner of the screen will vanish and the macro function
will have been created.  Pressing the appropriate function key
thereafter will repeat the entire command or series of commands.
(Example: If you want time to pass more quickly, press [control] and
F1 and then release them when REC.MAC.01 appears in the upper left
corner of the screen.  Now press [ESC] several times, and then press
<control> and F1.  Every subsequent time you press F1, time will pass
as if you had pressed [ESC] several times.  A macro function can be
erased by pressing and holding down [control] and pressing the
appropriate function key twice.
