<h1>The Pretty Good Wasteland Guide</h1><br>

<b>Version 1.0<br>
Written and coded by Per Jorner</b><br><br>

<i>Wasteland is a great game the first time through. The world is so large, and it takes so long to figure out what you actually have to do. But after a long struggle (usually about a hundred hours...much less if you have help) you finally set the sequence in Cochise, and walk, do not run, to the nearest exit. It's worth it.</i><br>

<a name="intro"></a><h3>Introduction</h3>

<blockquote><i>Something, the sound of metal on metal, grinds in the darkness...</i></blockquote>

What is <i>Wasteland</i> anyway? It's a post-apocalyptic computer role-playing game (in the sense that you batter lots of monsters into oblivion and take their stuff) which was released in 1987 and is still considered by many to be one of the best computer games ever created. It's a strangely satisfying mixture of exploration, item hoarding, frantic combat, certified cyborgs and toaster repair.<br><br>

You may know I already wrote a couple of guides for the first two games in the <i>Fallout</i> series. Fact is that even before I came across those games I toyed with the idea of writing a walkthrough for what was then my favourite computer game - <i>Wasteland</i> - but what for? Does anyone have access to this old game any more, let alone play it? Even the <i>Fallout</i> guide met with only a fraction of the interest that was lavished upon its <i>Fallout 2</i> counterpart. But in any case, working on those two was fun (of course, or I'd have been crazy to do it; some would say I still am) and provided me with the necessary impetus to realize that older idea.<br><br>

So why is this guide not "nearly ultimate" like the others? Well, the <i>Fallout</i> games have been pretty thoroughly picked apart, the game files unpacked and the scripts decompiled by people who are more cunning than me when it comes to these things. As far as I know the same cannot be easily accomplished for <i>Wasteland</i>. In <i>Fallout</i>, if you could go into a corner and use the broken flare on a chink in the wall to gain a big fat gun, there was a good chance we'd find it. Here it's more a matter of touch-and-go. Was it the proper code sequence that made the door fling open? Or the purple fnagazzi in your inventory? Or the fact that you killed that obnoxious robot on level 2? The game's relative simplicity makes up for this to some extent, but things such as skill use and combat mechanics are still rather opaque.<br><br>

For a few useful notes and details I'm indebted to the <i>Wasteland FAQ</i> by Stephen Sedmak and Chris Baer, and Stephen Mackie's <i>Wasteland</i> file for the Universal Hint System. I also got some tips on bugs, cheats and exploits from the Wasteland Underground section of the Wasteland Ranger HQ-Grid website. Cheers to <i>Wasteland</i> fans everywhere!<br><br>

Please note that <b>spoilers abound</b>. The first time you play a game like this, you really shouldn't be using any kind of walkthrough whatsoever. If you don't care enough about the unique experience of finding out and doing things on your own to abstain from spoiling it, you probably have better things to do with your time than play the game at all. So, in case this is your first game, don't read beyond Preparations. Of course you will anyway if you want to, so I don't know why I'm writing this. :)<br><br>

There's no big point in mailing me with gameplay or technical questions that don't have anything to do with the guide itself (unless it hints at a deficiency therein); it can be assumed that everything I know has gone into the guide.<br><br>

<a name="prep"><h3>Preparations</h3>

<blockquote><i>Four foot tall pears, pleasingly plump, perfectly prepared possibly, to plummet perilously from their precarious perches and pummel any passing pedestrian to a pasty, putrid, pulp.</i></blockquote>

The first thing you have to do is get hold of a copy of the game. There are a few ways of doing this:

<ul>
<li>Play the original Apple II or Commodore 64 version on an actual Apple II or C64 machine.
<li>Download an Apple II or C64 emulator from the net and locate the corresponding game files which should be available on several dedicated sites.
<li>Try to find a copy of the PC version. It has been included on at least two Interplay budget compilations; these don't seem to be available at the time of writing, but if you're scouring the budget bins or scouting for used copies they're probably easier to find than the original.
<li>Search a few abandonware sites to see if the PC version is available for downloading. Such sites will sometimes tell you where a game is available for purchase if it's currently being sold.
</ul>

Please do <i>not</i> mail me asking me to share or help you locate game files, or ask for help with emulators; I simply won't do it.<br><br>

This guide will cover the C64 and PC versions, skipping by the Apple II version which I haven't seen and will make no effort to investigate (assuming it is more or less identical with the C64 version). So what's good and bad with either version? I find the C64 graphics and presentation decidedly more attractive. One advantage of the PC version is that you don't have to swap disks, but its most endearing feature is the ability to make macros, which means you can rest for a long time with a single keystroke or set up a skill such as Picklock for quick use.<br><br>

If you're playing the C64 version, you'll have to begin by using the in-game disk copying utility, getting a taste of that old disk swapping. I think you have to do this once, after that be sure to make a copy of the fresh playing disks and put them in a separate directory. Then whenever you want to start a new game (or employ disk swapping cheats), copy these into your "play" folder. A few pointers on the emulated version:

<ul>
<li>In my experience you can <i>not</i> begin a session by loading a saved state (even at the title screen). I'm not sure why, but this will cause an I/O error when you try to read from any of the play disks. You must start by booting from the first master disk.
<li>You probably want to up the speed a bit, in the range of 150-200%.
<li>You can use save state as a quicksave function. Very useful when disarming bombs, picking up random loot bags and checking whether it's worth it to blast open a door or recruit an NPC. Remember though that the game saves each map when you leave it. It's OK to load a saved state from the previous map you were on (because you bring back the "proper" state of that map, and the last map was never saved anyway), but if you enter a sequence of maps and then load state you may miss out on enemies and items.
<li>The game saves each area when you leave it (including if you use the view command to control a party on another map), or when you use the save or radio commands. Leaving a location also saves your party (no matter which disk you're on), and this is what you get if you choose "no" when the game asks if you want to load the last save. If you choose "yes", you'll get the party which is currently saved on disk 1, i.e. using save or radio or entering or exiting the world map. Of course, maps will always be in the state they were last saved, even if this happened in between saving your party on disk 1 and turning off the computer. This means that although you'll usually answer "yes" because it's faster, it can in rare circumstances lead to a situation where you've taken crucial items from a location but don't have them. In that case you might have to resort to disk switching.
<li>Yep, disk swapping cheats work just fine (see Addenda).
<li>Don't mess with or close the emulator while the game is saving to disk. This may result in pretty much the same thing as if you ripped a play disk from a real disk drive while it was working (i.e. the loss of your game).
<li>The Esc key which is referred to in the guide is the "up arrow" key on the C64. The emulator uses the identically placed § key.
<li>S is used to view enemy groups in combat. Selecting a group is equivalent to an attack command (for NPCs pressing S is the same as pressing A).
</ul>

Some pointers on the PC version:

<ul>
<li>The game saves all maps when you leave them (or when you use save or radio), and unlike in the C64 version this is <i>always</i> the party you end up with when you start the game. This means you have to be a little extra careful about changing maps with injured party members, for instance.
<li>I'd ignore the clumsy mouse interface altogether and park the pointer in the lower right corner. If your computer isn't from the early 90s you'll just have your party zipping off in the wrong direction at the speed of light unless you tamper with the DOS settings.
<li>You should always save (manually or by instantly leaving for another map) after leaving an important shop. If you quit or otherwise shut down the game before this, the shop will "disappear" permanently. This bug is PC-specific.
<li><nobr>Ctrl-A</nobr> is used instead of S to view enemy groups in combat.
<li>You can reportedly feed your characters' stats directly to your printer by pressing P. I haven't verified this and don't see a real use for it.
</ul>

Whatever version you're using you should make a complete backup of your game at, say, each quarter-way point through the game (roughly when leaving Quartz, leaving Vegas, and leaving Darwin). Not so much because you could corrupt the files as because you could actually get stuck or kill off some or all of your party permanently. In the emulated C64 version just back up the playing disk images, in the PC version back up the Game1 and Game2 files.

<blockquote><img height=12 src="stuff/star.gif" alt="a red star" align=left>
There has been talk of two different PC versions which differ only in minute details. I tend to think that this is not true. For one thing, I cannot really imagine why any publisher would want to make minor and inconsequential alterations to a re-release (heaven knows they never do it to fix bugs). For another thing, the perceived differences can usually be explained; for instance the supposed non-existence of the Onyx ring in the Citadel, reported by players who have as a rule been looking for it in the wrong place.</blockquote>

<a name="char"><h3>Character design</h3>

<blockquote><i>You did it! Gee you are good at that. Maybe you should go adventuring with a skill like that.</i></blockquote>

OK, first of all delete those pre-defined characters. They've got lousy stats and you don't want to go through the game with characters made by someone else anyway. Here's some stuff to think about:

<ul>
<li>Sex doesn't affect your stats or anything else. There are two places in the game where sex matters, and none is even remotely significant. Nationality doesn't do anything as far as anyone knows.
<li>You need about 10 skill points for the basic skill assortment. Every character should then have 5-8 points for specialization if they started out with IQ 15-18.
<li>It's not worth it to buy more than 2 levels in a skill from the beginning (or indeed ever). It will go up anyway as you use it.
<li>Initial MAXCON ranges from 22 to 36. You can use it as a deciding factor if you roll stats that are OK but not great.
<li>After you start playing you can only train skills at a library, and the first one is in Needles. That's quite a bit into the game, so choose wisely at the start.
<li>You don't have to spend all skill points for a character.
<li>You don't have to start with four characters, but there's no reason not to.
<li>It's a good idea to make notes of which character has which skills, both for character creation (so you don't accidentally duplicate a skill) and for convenience during play.
<li>Most or all skills are associated with a stat, e.g. to be really good at Gamble you should have a high Luck as well.
<li>If you think rolling for stats is the most boring thing imaginable, don't sweat it. You can probably finish the game with quite sucky stats (except maybe IQ) as long as you get the right skills and equipment.
</ul>

<blockquote><img height=12 src="stuff/star3.gif" alt="a green star" align=left>
There's a way to get more guns and ammo at the start of the game, but it's something of a cheat. Just trade all equipment to one of your characters, enter the Ranger Center, delete the others and create new ones. They'll have new weapons, and you can then repeat the process. If you're playing the PC version you can even set up a macro to this effect.</blockquote>

<h4>Stats</h4>

<ul>
<li><b>Strength (ST):</b> Affects close combat damage, but not carrying capacity. Can be used to kick in doors.
<li><b>Intelligence (IQ):</b> You need this for initial skill points, 15-18. You shouldn't accept any lower than that since you'll need to raise it to 23 eventually.
<li><b>Luck (LK):</b> Reportedly affects the contents of loot bags as well as... well, different random stuff.
<li><b>Speed (SP):</b> Affects order of attack in close combat, and is probably also used to check if you can jump clear of pitfalls and swirling razor blades.
<li><b>Agility (AG):</b> Affects close combat and evasion. Possibly helps you avoid things like traps and snakebites.
<li><b>Dexterity (DX):</b> Affects shooting, so a medium to good DX is preferable. Used for things like picking locks.
<li><b>Charisma (CH):</b> Can be used in a few places to minimal effect.
</ul>

<h4>Skills</h4>

The numbers within parentheses below represent the IQ needed to learn the skill and the basic cost of the skill respectively.<br><br>

Skills that every character should have:

<ul>
<li><b>Brawling (3/1):</b> The primary hand-to-hand skill which you need in case you run out of ammo at the wrong time. Buy 2 levels, because it will double your number of attacks (you can imagine that this makes a difference), and you'll want to use this early on.
<li><b>Climb (3/1):</b> A cheap convenience. Though only one character really needs it to get you past obstacles, you can raise it for free later.
<li><b>Swim (3/1):</b> See Climb.
<li><b>Perception (6/1):</b> Useful for finding many things, such as land mines.
<li><b>Assault rifle (9/1):</b> Used for the best low-tech weapons.
<li><b>AT weapon (9/1):</b> Good to have in case you must blast off a rocket.
<li><b>Energy weapons (23/3):</b> For all weapons powered by Power packs.
</ul>

Skills that only 1-2 characters need:

<ul>
<li><b>Picklock (10/1):</b> Used to open many doors.
<li><b>Silent move (10/1):</b> Put this on the lead character.
<li><b>Demolitions (13/1):</b> Possibly used when throwing Grenades, so load all of those on one character if you're not selling them. This is <i>not</i> used for opening doors.
<li><b>Bomb disarm (15/2):</b> You might want to put 2 here because the consequences of a failure can be aggravating. That's 6 skill points, so you need an IQ 16-18 character for this.
<li><b>Medic (15/2):</b> Put this on two characters for healing early on. Getting 2 from the beginning is not worth the cost.
<li><b>Safecrack (15/2):</b> Used in a few places.
<li><b>Cryptology (16/2):</b> Ditto. You can put this off until Las Vegas.
<li><b>Helicopter pilot (19/3):</b> You don't really need this. If so, get 1 on one person.
<li><b>Toaster repair (20/3):</b> Get 1 on one person.
<li><b>Electronics (20/3):</b> Get 1 on one person (not if you're picking up Metal Maniac).
<li><b>Doctor (21/3):</b> Get 1 on two or more characters as soon as possible.
<li><b>Clone tech (22/3):</b> See Helicopter pilot.
<li><b>Cyborg tech (24/3):</b> Get 1 on one person.
</ul>

Mostly pointless weapon skills:

<ul>
<li><b>Clip pistol (3/1):</b> Bad idea, Brawling is much better early on.
<li><b>Knife fight (3/1):</b> Don't know why you'd want to fight with knives.
<li><b>Pugilism (3/1):</b> Brawling is much more powerful and you need that anyway to get multiple attacks.
<li><b>Rifle (3/1):</b> Can easily be bypassed in the weapon progression.
<li><b>Knife throw (6/1):</b> See Knife fight.
<li><b>SMG (9/1):</b> See Rifle.
</ul>

Skills which have no obvious or significant applications:

<ul>
<li><b>Acrobat (10/1):</b> Substitute for Agility in a few places.
<li><b>Gamble (10/1):</b> You don't need extra money, and there are no quest applications.
<li><b>Confidence (11/1):</b> Substitute for Charisma in a few places.
<li><b>Sleight of Hand (12/1):</b> Substitute for, well, just about anything else in Scott's Bar.
<li><b>Forgery (13/1):</b> Substitute for IQ in one place.
<li><b>Alarm disarm (14/1):</b> Substitute for Picklock in one place.
<li><b>Bureaucracy (14/1):</b> No idea.
<li><b>Metallurgy (17/2):</b> Only good for some decidedly minor cash in the Mine Shaft.
</ul>

Weird skills:

<ul>
<li><b>Combat shooting (11/1):</b> This skill only exists in the PC version and can only be learned during character creation. I don't think anyone knows what it does; it doesn't seem to help you shoot straight, at any rate.
</ul>

<h4>Sample party</h4>

This setup assumes you're going to use Brawling consistently until you get your hands on assault rifles in Savage Village (or until the going gets so tough you have to start using them). It's only a suggestion, you can dump some worthless skills and substitute others.<br><br>

</table><br>

Future developments:

<ul>
<li>Every character should have Energy weapon 1 eventually, and two should have Doctor 1 as soon as possible. In addition, a few of them need 3 additional skill points for the other advanced skills. This means you want to raise IQ at least 6 points for each character, or until you get to 23 (24 for Cyborg tech).
<li>After that, raise LK and AG if you're going to beat the game primarily using close combat (gets a bit hairy at Base Cochise), LK and DX if you're going in shooting. Or you can always raise MAXCON.
<li>It's normal to be around level 12-15 at the very end of the game if you get the maximum number of NPCs and don't go out of your way to fight random encounters; that means your PCs have had 24-30 character points each to spend, of which 6-9 have gone into IQ.
<li>Some NPCs such as Covenant need to spend about 6 points in IQ to get to 23, which means you can have them purchase an advanced skill.
<li>You must give Cyborg tech to the character you want to do the mind maze with.
</ul>

This is where the advanced skills are available:

<ul>
<li><b>Needles:</b> Electronics, Toaster repair, Doctor.
<li><b>Las Vegas:</b> Electronics, Toaster repair, Doctor, Energy weapon.
<li><b>Sleeper Base:</b> All.
<li><b>Darwin:</b> Toaster repair, Doctor, Clone tech.
<li><b>Citadel:</b> Electronics, Toaster repair, Clone tech, Energy weapon, Cyborg tech.
</ul>

<a name="areas"></a><h3>Area walkthrough</h3>

<blockquote><i>From the depths of the wasteland appears a hostile adversary.</i></blockquote>

General notes:

<ul>
<li>The term PC ("player character") is used in the guide to denote the characters you create in the Ranger Center, and sometimes more loosely to denote any member of your party whether created or recruited. NPC ("non-player character") always denotes a recruited character.
<li>Whenever you use a skill successfully, whether actively or passively, there's a chance it might go up. This chance is higher the more difficult the action or the more powerful the enemy. In some places in the game you can provoke such checks repeatedly, and you'll then notice that the skill of every party member will eventually rise to a certain level as you do this.
<li>You need at least one level in a skill to raise it through experience. You can't raise a skill to a higher level than your rank (except during character creation), but that should rarely be a problem.
<li>You can be promoted more than one rank at a time, so you never risk "wasting" experience.
<li>The highest rank ("Supreme Jerk"), and hence skill level, is 181.
<li>Loot bags will remain on the map indefinitely, but once you pick something up you must keep it, sell it or lose it forever.
<li>Many loot bags trigger special events when ransacked. You can actually avoid lots of unpleasant things (traps and ambushes) by leaving an item in the bag, but that's silly. At other times you must empty a bag to make something good happen, even if you don't really want the stuff.
<li>An unconscious PC will eventually recover. A wounded PC will just get worse.
<li>There are many ways to open locked doors, boxes and cabinets. Weak doors can be opened with Strength, Picklock, a Sledgehammer or a Crowbar (Axes and Pick axes work too; maybe these objects are interchangeable in this respect). Generally, any door that can be smashed can also be picked. For some "vaultlike" doors Safecrack provides an alternative. Strong doors need TNT to blast them open, or exceptional Strength. A few doors found late in the game require the use of Plastic explosives.
<li>You can only divide your party into four groups. You cannot disband a created PC forever unless he or she is dead.
<li>Time does pass for all parties when you move around with one. Inactive parties won't trigger events or random encounters, though.
<li>You can press <nobr>Ctrl-R</nobr> to rearrange skills or items in the character display. Use this to put active skills such as Climb, Picklock and Doctor at the top of the first skill selection list so you don't have to scroll to find them.
<li>Each character can carry a maximum of 30 items. There are no encumberment or bulkiness factors, i.e. you can carry 30 Matches or you can carry 30 Engines.
<li>I have no idea if you get any "quest" experience for doing extra stuff like talking to the riddler, delivering the Bloodstaff or flying the helicopter, but I don't think so (because I've had "mule" NPCs tagging along for a long while without ever gaining levels). You do get minor experience for active or passive use of skills, though.
<li>Using the radio command or entering a new area (including shops, libraries and hospitals) saves the game automatically. Do not do this if you have dead, poisoned or seriously injured party members and are not sure you can save them. Yes, it <i>is</i> possible to lose an entire game this way.
<li>Radioactive squares are marked with a trifoil symbol during night hours (18-06). You will never be radiated unless you step directly on such a square.
<li>The game never checks to see if you should know a password or not, e.g. you can dig up the nomads' cache before doing the Visa card quest.
</ul>

Some general notes on shops:

<ul>
<li>Shops can be divided roughly into two categories: shops that only buy and sell equipment (and maybe a few mêlée weapons), and shops that buy and sell everything. In the first category you find the Highpool shop, the Nomads' trading car, the Agricultural Center (which only deals in farming stuff) and the general store in Darwin. The black market in Darwin deals only in guns, ammo and armour.
<li>Shops do retain items you sell them. You can sell off items you find but don't want to use at the time (e.g. Power packs) and buy them back when needed (cash is probably not an issue). Sell such stuff in one shop so you know where it is, I suggest the Quartz shop since it's the most accessible.
<li>You can't sell off quest items. If you know you have no further use for them, drop them.
<li>Shops do eventually run out of stock items such as ammo (though it never happened to me).
</ul>

Notes on the world map:

<ul>
<li>If you go into the desert (more than one or two paces) you'll suffer heat damage. Each character needs a Canteen to be protected from this.
<li>Don't go into the desert northeast of the Desert Nomads. Darwin is surrounded by a belt of radioactivity.
<li>Don't jump into the river unless you have good Swim on all characters. The chance of raising Swim in this way is slim, and it can take quite a while before you get to climb out (you don't even get to do it automatically when you reach a bridge).
<li>You can pass by the Guardian Citadel safely if you heed the warnings.
<li>Enemies will not appear on "hot" desert squares, so you can rest safely if you're surrounded by such squares (Canteens are recommended for this).
<li>Random encounters are the same all over the map (i.e. no mad robots outside Vegas or Cochise to prevent you from going there at an early stage).
</ul>

Some suggestions for macros if you have them:

<ul>
<li>Lots of Esc's for resting (outdoors or indoors).
<li>Picklock, letting you choose a direction.
<li>Perception, used on the current square.
<li>Medic or Doctor for your 1-2 best doctors, letting you choose a character.
</ul>
<hr>

<a name="high"></a><h3>Highpool</h3>

<blockquote><i>A tumbleweed bounces past you. You hear the distant laughter of children.</i></blockquote>

This is visible just to the west of the Ranger Center. In the largest building you'll find a shop. Open the door with Strength, a Crowbar or Picklock and you can go in and read a few notes. This will also make a couple of Juvies appear, and you can kill them with no repercussions (they should have a Mangler, which is a kind of rocket).<br><br>

If you go into the bottom left building there's a small stash in the bed, and a water pump that needs fixing (IQ or Perception will confirm this). Once you've got a spare Engine, use it here to fix the water purifier (what is this, <i>Fallout</i>?). The generous reward for this will be 4 Leather jackets and some other stuff. Good if it's your first armour!<br><br>

The bottom right building has a doctor, but it's just not worth it to purchase healing (especially if you have a resting macro). Use doctors in the rare event that you get an affliction.<br><br>

You can talk to the kid standing in the corner about "dog", "rex", "jackie" and "cave". Once you mention the last one he'll tell you where the cave is and run away. Go to the square between the two trees and use first Perception, then a Rope on that square to enter (you can do this before talking to the kid).<br><br>

Inside the cave you have to use Climb to pass the rubbly bits. After the first obstacle you'll be attacked by a dog. You'd better equip your pistols, 'cause fists don't do much damage to it. In the upper left corner you find Jackie who can be recruited into the party. Once you get up out of the cave and go north, you'll encounter Bobby (the kid you talked to before) who complains that you killed his dog. He won't actually move to attack you, but you must waste him anyway.<br><br>

When you feel you're finished with Highpool (do the Engine thing first), step in the creek south of the bridge. There are two "slippery" squares which will make kids appear. Killing both groups makes two more appear, kill them too. Eventually a Chubby Kid appears. When you've killed him and taken his stuff, you'll face the Red Ryder (whoever that is). He can be pretty tough for a low-level party. Once he's taken care of the creek will dry up and you can't enter any of the buildings any more.

The valley doesn't change until you empty the Red Ryder's loot bag, so if you resist the temptation to grab that clip you can kill the kids and still retain access to the doctor. But it doesn't matter much. I actually like the descriptions of the empty valley a lot.</blockquote>
<hr>

<a name="agri"></a><h3>Agricultural Center</h3>

<blockquote><i>A large farmer is walking around among the green leaves of this carrot patch. Sensing your approach, he stops moving and watches you with his ominous eyes, filled with hatred for you and your kind.</i></blockquote>

When you enter and step in front of the (closed) shop you'll meet some troubled people. If you decline to help you may be pelted for 1 hit point by a kid, and you can then press Esc and change your mind about helping. Once you offer to help you're transported into the garden. You can pick the doors to get out again if you want. If you walk in the middle passage you'll be exposed to pretty harmless catapult fire.<br><br>

Moving about the strange plants, you'll face some randomly popping rodents as well as stationary ones (you need to actually step on the plants to find those). In the second row from the left in the bottom section you find Harry the Bunny Master. Beat him up (ignore the Bunnies until he's dead, he hits hard) and you'll have saved the poor farmers; random attacks in the garden will continue, but the catapults stop.<br><br>

Go over to the guy by the root cellar and you'll get to go down there. In four of the crates you'll find some stuff. You can find a diary if you use Perception on one of the tables. The shop will have opened as well, but it's basically just a place to sell off Fruits.<br><br>

In the bottom left corner of the garden there's a passage leading to a cave system. It's a pretty minor area with rodents; exiting to the desert from there takes you outside the Agricultural Center.<br><br><hr>

<a name="nomad"></a><h3>Desert Nomads</h3>

<blockquote><i>The guard looks at you sternly and replies that the Atchison clan has no time for small talk.</i></blockquote>

Follow the mountains to the north, skipping by the Guardian Citadel, until you get to the square with the tents, and enter. Go to the caboose at the east end of the train and accept the Brakeman's mission (you won't get a second chance). Beware that the random encounters can be quite difficult at low levels (the experience values are higher than most monsters before the Temple of Blood in Needles), so don't linger.<br><br>

The hobo in the central car will give you rather useless clues if you use Snake squeezins on him (I can make a good guess as to what some of them mean, others are just weird). If you like gambling, use the casino car to raise Gamble to 10, maybe even making some money in the process, then move on. The trading car contains a shop that has an Engine for Highpool. The engineer will react to the keywords "chat", "brakeman", "hobo", "visa card" and maybe something else.<br><br>

When you have Head Crusher's codeword, "caterpillar", give it to the guy in the leftmost tent. Grab the Shovel, follow the instructions and use the Shovel on the ground to reap some loot. You'll be ambushed by three Rail Thieves, but they're not that tough.

<blockquote><img height=12 src="stuff/star.gif" alt="a red star" align=left>
If you tell the guard "ladybug" or "lizard", the two fake passwords from the paragraph book, you're instructed to read the fake paragraph 42... which however refers to a completely different place in the game. 67 is the correct number of the fake Atchison reward paragraph.</blockquote>

Next go to the middle tent and say "chat" or "caterpillar", whereupon you're invited into the tent. Go in and dispatch the Topekans and take their stuff. That ought to teach them. You can let the Broken toaster lie there until later, unless you want to carry it around for most of the game.<br><br><hr>

<a name="mine"></a><h3>Mine Shaft</h3>

<blockquote><i>Some pre-holocaust miner has hewn a tunnel into the living rock of the mountain. Now the smell tells you it is home for many desert creatures.</i></blockquote>

Smash the door and get the Rope from the corner. Pick or pry open the chest to get the Gas masks. Use Perception on all the green corpses to gain some small treasures. Whenever a group of monsters leaves a loot bag behind, taking the loot will trigger an ambush by several Little People with guns which can be dangerous especially if your party is weak and not equipped with ranged weapons.<br><br>

In the forked tunnel with a corpse north of the entrance, use Metallurgy on the innermost square in the lower tunnel (not on the wall). Then use a Pick ax on the same square to earn a few dollars each time. Yawn. In the diagonal tunnel directly to the left there's a trap which will cause a rockfall. It can raise your Perception, but I don't think you can spot the trap without triggering it. You can clear the collapsed tunnel with one TNT if you really must, but a failed Demolitions check will hurt you.<br><br>

The end of the short tunnel in the northwest corner of the map can be mined as well. Watch out for the nearby Shadowclaw! The corpse in the spirally tunnel should have a Bullet proof shirt. You can admire the largest boulder in the world (the big round thing, like a ball of twine except it's made of stone), but not do anything with it as far as I know. And that's it for the mine.<br><br><hr>

<a name="savage"></a><h3>Savage Village</h3>

<blockquote><i>Lizards are everywhere.</i></blockquote>

The place of the Junkyard Village in the order of areas is a little tricky. On the one hand, you're really only supposed to be able to figure out the password ("redhawk") after you've been to Needles at least. On the other hand, if you finished the game already you'll know the password, and you can blast the gates with TNT anyway.<br><br>

If you do, any Scavs and Pack Rats you find inside will be hostile. Round them all up, including the women and children. You should find large quantities of Spears as well as several M1989A1 Nato assault rifles. Groovy. If you fall (or jump) into the well there are some Lizards to fight. Use Climb to get back up.<br><br>

Kill the Reclaimers and other sentries to the northwest, enter the stores and take their stuff. When you open the chest you may be inflicted with Desert dust, which is a potent poison (high Picklock or a Crowbar helps you avoid it). In that case, go straight to a doctor (using Medic along the way if necessary), or that character will die.

<blockquote><img height=12 src="stuff/star3.gif" alt="a green star" align=left>
A cheap trick to get good weapons straight away in a game is to go here first of all, give the password at the gate, then go pick the door to the room with assault rifles. The Scavs will be upset, but you now have the means to show them you don't really care. This is a bit more efficient than fiddling with pistols, rifles and SMGs at the start of the game.</blockquote>

The chieftain lives in one of the buildings at the top. Tell him "redhawk" or that you bring a gift, and you can enter. He doesn't care that you butchered his people (bit of a primitive game engine). Bring him Redhawk (who will stay in your party) or the Grazer bat fetish and he'll tell you where Base Cochise is (but not actually make it appear on the world map - only Max does that).<br><br><hr>

<a name="quartz"></a><h3>Quartz</h3>

<blockquote><i>As you step next to a pile of laundry... two super ninja coydogs surprise you.</i></blockquote>

There are six manholes, arranged in a three-by-two pattern, which will "teleport" you across town. This is good if you want to avoid random encounters. There's nothing in most buildings except snakes and the like which may bite and poison you: tarantulas (Bug byte), rats, snapping turtles, flying scorpions (Bug byte), a snake (Desert dust), scorpions, black widows, yellow spiders, more rats (Rabies), and a transparent snake.<br><br>

The Quartz Emporium is the building in the bottom left corner of the Quartz map (Scott the bartender will give its location away). It's a pretty good shop if you want to unload junk or buy 7.62mm clips. By the time you're taking on Quartz, if not sooner, you should be able to afford Bullet proof shirts for the whole party.<br><br>

Go into the graveyard to the east by smashing the gates. Kill the undead and hold on to that Broken toaster, or leave it there for now. (A pity you can't use a Shovel on the graves.) There's a doctor in the northwest part of town, on the north side of Pyramid Drive.<br><br>

<h4>Scott's Bar</h4>

The building to the southwest of the graveyard is Scott's Bar. You can talk to the guy in the northwest corner, buy him three drinks ($10 apiece) and answer his three riddles ("toast", "r", "urabutln") and he'll only tell you to say "urabutln" to the barmaid.<br><br>

If you go near the ramp to the stage you get to kill a few punks, and after you loot their bodies you get a clue (IQ and Cryptology should help you interpret the note, but it's a red herring anyway). Step into the center of the stage and you get to fight a few Bouncers. There will be an "invisible" loot bag where they were... but if you step up to retrieve it, you're stuck. There's a number of ways to please the crowd and escape: Agility, Acrobat, Confidence, Sleight of hand, Charisma, Knife throw and possibly more. If you do something unamusing, you get hit with bottles.<br><br>

North of the bar there are some punks. Shove them or ignore them and they'll fight you. Disband a character and walk along the row of seats until you find Ellen, tell her "urabutln" to get a Room key #18. Scott himself can give you coffee at $10 and very minor clues.<br><br>

In the southeast corner of the main hall is the Head Crusher. The tricky thing here is to use the Brakeman's Visa card on the chair, not on the table or Head Crusher himself. You get a password in return and can then talk to Head Crusher ("chat" and "dancer" are valid topics, but they lead nowhere).<br><br>

Go into the men's room, kill the Outlaw and talk to the other guy ("ugly", "riddler", "courthouse", "mayor", "gang"). Send a woman into the ladies' room and use Charisma or Confidence on the women for a minor clue. You can also disturb a card game by the rear entrance for some cash (after killing the owners, of course). This might actually be easier if you enter that way if you're not using ranged weapons.

<h4>Stagecoach Inn</h4>

This is the blue building northwest across the street from the large blue Courthouse, which will be covered later. If you go to the clerk and rent a room you will get a Passkey for $50 (no real point). Use Climb, Strength or a Sledgehammer on the railing, kill the Clerk and dogs, then use Bomb Disarm and Picklock on the cabinet for a Plastic explosives and some cash.<br><br>

In and around the cantina there are some thugs. Harass the cook and take his cleaver. Bwahahah. Now let's go through the rooms, starting with the one in the bottom corner and going counterclockwise. Note that in addition to the normal Picklock, Crowbar etc. all the rooms can be entered using the Passkey.<br><br>

#10 is your room and is empty. #11 has Bums and Mongrels in it. Fight them and get the Snake squeezin from under the chair. You can talk to the green bum and ask him about "chat", "money", "secret", "gang". When you say "courthouse", "mayor" or "back way" he'll tell you about the secret passage to the Courthouse and pass out.

<blockquote><img height=12 src="stuff/star3.gif" alt="a green star" align=left>
If you ask the bum about money and find the bag under the chair, you can leave the room and go down to the fence, then step on the third square from the east wall. You'll find a loot bag which is a duplicate of the one from the chair. In the PC version you can use this bug to cheat (see Addenda).</blockquote>

In room #12, step on the green guy by the table and the others will become available for slaughter. There doesn't seem to be anything more you can do about the writer. In #14 there's a lone survival nut. He's not visible at first, run into the room and he'll appear. There's a cache under the chair in the corner. In #15 there are some thugs and dogs. Use Perception on the table for another bottle of Snake squeezin.<br><br>

Pick the door to Housekeeping, then use Perception on the shelf with the chemicals to gain one Chemical. Pick the cabinet, dispatching any angry housekeepers that appear. Note that you probably want to leave both the Chemical and the Servo motor where they are for now. Use your newly acquired bottles of booze on the bums to make them leave. At the end of the passage is an exit to the Courthouse.<br><br>

Room #16 is empty. In room #17 there's some loose change under the bed.<br><br>

Room #18 contains Laurie, the sister of the guy in the men's room at Scott's. There are several things that can happen here:

<ul>
<li>You have the Room #18 key and use it on the door, then tell her "urabutln" or "uraqt2". She'll give you a swag bag and the password to the Courthouse.
<li>You have the proper room key but don't give her the right word. She'll then request a Servo motor. If you have the one from Housekeeping, you'll give it to her automatically and you get the reward.
<li>You enter the room using any other means than the Room #18 key (including the Passkey). Step forward and you'll get a grenade tossed at you, then Laurie attacks. Once she's dead and you loot her things (Servo motor), the game will call you "scum" and you don't get the swag bag.
<li>Enter the room in the wrong way, but use Confidence or Charisma on the square where you're standing. You'll then get to enter a password as above. If you fail two attempts at pleasing her, she'll attack (but not toss the grenade).
</ul>

Room #19 is empty. Room #20 holds some thugs, and you must use Bomb disarm on the bed to gain the contents of a small cache. Once all the doors are open you can discard the keys if you didn't already.

<blockquote><img height=12 src="stuff/star.gif" alt="a red star" align=left>
There's a small Easter egg just outside the inn. From Ben Morgan's walkthrough: "If you walk north and stand on the tree just outside the entrance and walk into the wall of the building directly north of you, it gives you a message."</blockquote>

<h4>Courthouse</h4>

The Courthouse is the big blue building to the north of the bar. If you enter from the front, tell them "ugly" (this doesn't matter, really) and "muerte" if you want to do things peacefully. I suggest you don't (more kills for you). If you go left towards the stairs you may be attacked even if you gave the right password. If you go into the atrium (the secret passage to the Stagecoach Inn is in the back), you can use Climb on the vines to get to levels 2 and 3 and then smash the glass to get in.<br><br>

On level 2, thugs will attack near the stairs. You can search the drawers in the room to the left (use Perception) for some Snake squeezin which will come in handy, and here you also find the password to the hideout. The green guys in the passage usually don't do anything, though they may also demand that you give the password. In the room on the lower right there are some thugs.<br><br>

Now make sure you have Silent move on your party leader. Open the door and then step onto the sentry. If successful, you'll dispatch him without him sounding the alarm. In either case you have to fight the people in the cell. You get a Jewelry and a paragraph reference for each of Huey, Dewey and Louie. If you didn't knock Louie out, the torture victim will be dead. Otherwise, use a Snake squeezin (which is used up) or a Canteen (which is not used up) on him to revive him, then recruit him. This is Dan Citrine and he's actually good for one thing other than carrying stuff.<br><br>

There's not much to do on level 3. The Knifers by the door most often take off when you approach, though they can also fight and in that case leave behind a Sonic key (which you'll find later anyway). Recruit Mayor Pedros if you like. In the cell to the southeast, if you step on the bed without Dan Citrine in your party, a guy runs out the door. If you have Dan with you, you earn $1000 instead.

<h4>Hideout</h4>

The hideout is the blue building northeast of the Courthouse. First, go into the alley beside it and you'll knock out some sentries. Use a Rope on the wall where it tells you to. You can now walk up and down the glass (or press Esc) and quickly raise the Perception of all characters to 3 if your rank allows it. Afterwards you can break the glass with a Crowbar or the like and end up inside, fighting lots of people. Works for me.<br><br>

If you enter by the front door you can give the password ("kaput") and not be attacked. If you say "thanatos", the old password, they ask for the name of your section leader, the correct answer to which is "stinger" (a name shouted by some goons in the Courthouse). You have to kill a door guard to reach the inner rooms, but not the pistoleros even after you kill Ugly.

<blockquote><img height=12 src="stuff/star3.gif" alt="a green star" align=left>
If you give the password "mors" from the fake paragraph you'll still get to enter unmolested... but at the same time the game surreptitiously changes the gender of all your characters! You can just say "mors" again to reverse this effect, though.</blockquote>

Use Climb on the fence to enter the kennels. Make sure you kill everyone (they're utter wimps) and you get quite a lot of clips. Go behind the curved counter to find a secret staircase. Go down there and use TNT on the left door (Picklock works if you're really patient) to find Ace, who's actually a half-decent NPC. The other cell is empty, so don't bother.<br><br>

North of the officer's club you can pick up 3 Chemicals from a table (but there's no reason to do that just yet, or perhaps ever - they'll eat inventory space). The cabinets must be Picklocked, if you smash them you don't get any stuff. Explore the pile in the corner for some super ninja coydog action.<br><br>

Kill the Guard. Step behind the table in the next room to reveal a safe. If you enter the numbers on the ID bracelets of the triplets in the Courthouse ("11-16-27") you can loot a Kevlar vest (wahoo), a Sabot rocket and an M19 rifle (all that in a wall safe?). Safecrack 1 also works if you give it enough tries.

<blockquote><img height=12 src="stuff/star.gif" alt="a red star" align=left>
It <i>may</i> be more difficult to notice the safe in the PC version, which has led some to believe that it's not there. It is, however; just walk repeatedly in front of the safe and you will spot it eventually. It seems rather random which skill is used for this; it has been known to raise Perception, Safecrack, Picklock and even Clip pistol!</blockquote>

Enter the room to the east. It appears Ugly set up Felicia the bomb and she has no chance to survive make her time. You can let him go, in which case you get the bomb disarm code ("11-27-57-04-30"), or you can easily waste him (Uzi SMG Mark 27 and Bullet proof shirt). If you didn't get the code, use Bomb disarm twice to save Felicia, who will join you as an NPC. Or you could fail and check out the "Felicia parts". Then open the door to the vault (Picklock works fine) for some major cash. After you're done carrying all the loot to the shop, I suggest you get rid of Mayor Pedros, Felicia and/or Dan Citrine if you picked them up as mules.

<blockquote><img height=12 src="stuff/star.gif" alt="a red star" align=left>
Yes, you can make Mayor Pedros kill his wife with his bare fists.</blockquote>
<hr>

<a name="needles"></a><h3>Needles</h3>

<blockquote><i>The girl behind the counter, writhing and bleeding, gasps, "Would you like... fries with your... order?" She dies.</i></blockquote>

If you recruit Ace and go to the broken-down jeep north of Quartz, he'll fix it and you'll automatically drive to Needles and the gas station. The jeep will remain there until you get an Engine and talk to the mechanic with Ace still in your party. This whole jeep thing is rather superfluous, but it serves as a sort of link between areas.<br><br>

There are two places in Needles where there are radioactive squares: down at the waste dump, and up in the northwest section around the temple. Watch out if it's daytime. Walk around the sand dunes in the southern part to raise Climb to 3 and Acrobat to at least 2. When you reach the crest of the largest dune you find a clue (the password to the Savage Village). You can ride the train if you like (whee?). Try to take the shortest route whenever you're moving around in Needles; the random encounters can be quite annoying and are not worth much experience.<br><br>

In the enclosure to the northeast there are several useful buildings, among them a doctor and a library. Enter the ammo bunker (the stair thing). Pick up the stuff from the corpse and the shelves (quite a lot of ammo). You must use Bomb disarm on the shelf with Plastic explosives, and I don't know if it's at all possible to do anything with the unstable TNT (neither Bomb disarm nor Demolitions work).

<blockquote><img height=12 src="stuff/star3.gif" alt="a green star" align=left>
You'll find several fake Bloodstaffs throughout Needles. They can be dropped at once. When you find the real one it will be sort of obvious.</blockquote>

In the police station you can talk to a detective who'll give you some superficial info on the Bloodstaff mystery. Fighting the police robots in the barracks doesn't alert anyone. You can also pick the cell doors with impunity and recruit Mort if you like. If you pick the door to the room with the carrier pigeons you can turn off the alarm in the armoury by pressing "0". I wouldn't do that, however, since you miss out on killing an Auto rifle. Pick the door to the armoury (Picklock 3 is enough if you try a lot) and step inside. This doesn't turn anyone else hostile, either. The real police fight only starts when you kill the guy by the counter, then step on the square where he was. The most convenient way to take out these goons is probably to fire full auto at each group.<br><br>

In the southeast corner of Needles, enter the Servants of the Mushroom Cloud church. Use the Ruby ring from the ammo bunker in front of the bishop. He'll tell you to retrieve the Bloodstaff (whatever that is). If you bring a fake one, he'll break it and throw you out. When you give him the real one you get a big loot bag including an Engine (for the jeep), several assault rifles (as if you didn't have enough by now) and a Kevlar suit. You can also talk to him; when you get the codeword from Charmaine you can return and tell him "dipstick" to get the Bloodstaff back from him. You can do it now if you want to save yourself the trip.

<blockquote><img height=12 src="stuff/star3.gif" alt="a green star" align=left>
If you tell him "pastel" or "buzzard" from the fake paragraphs, you get a correspondingly fake Bloodstaff (and you cannot pick up the real one afterwards). Charmaine will not be pleased.</blockquote>

Enter the waste dump, preferably during nighttime. On the second level you can make it to the stairs without using explosives; going into the room on the right is pointless. On the third level you have to blow up two doors before you can get anywhere. The Pit Ghoul is a fearsome opponent, but a full round of assault rifle auto-fire will probably get rid of it (and is much cheaper than pelting it with rockets). Watch out for the contaminated square. If you blast into the lower room you find 2 Rad suits, some weapons and ammo, but there's nothing in the other.

<h4>Downtown</h4>

In the western part you can buy hobo dogs. I don't think that does anything. Kill a couple of guards and gain entry to a basement with a Bloodstaff verification device (does this make sense to anyone?). Use fake Bloodstaffs here to make them go crunch. As you enter the basement there's a sort of harmless trap.<br><br>

You can buy Snake squeezin for $15 in the restaurant (you can use Climb on the fence to get there if you hate stairs). In the occult shop you can use Perception on the crystal ball for a cute message. South of the hobo dog stand you can break in and get some minor item off the desk. In the empty room east of the occult shop you can read some messages, including "No mutants allowed" (though in the PC version it says "Mutants not allowed" instead - sheesh), game credits, and something that looks oddly like a Tomb Raider reference although that didn't exist at the time. In the next room there are two bums. Using 2 Snake squeezins on the one on the right will give you the password to the gambling club.<br><br>

Use Howitzer shells (there's a couple in the ammo dump, and more in the temple) on the howitzer to the northeast (this may improve people's AT weapon as well as Demolitions, not just the character who was carrying the shell), and you'll get to select a firing trajectory. Each one will make a crater, smash a wall or something (high and low west are basically the same). The only one that really changes anything is the high southwest, which will hit the hobo dog stand. Go talk to the girl behind the counter for a laugh. Ah, the world would be safer without nameless scum.<br><br>

If you go to the east side, you can buy Snake squeezin for $10 and enter Leroy's arms shop to unload junk and maybe buy clips if you don't have a lot already. Kill the loitering Jerks. Recruit Christina standing nearby and take her Rad suit, Geiger counter and stuff (you don't get it if you kill her). There's a bottle of Snake squeezin on the ground behind the club. The password to enter the club and gamble is "acapulco", but I wouldn't gamble there.

<blockquote><img height=12 src="stuff/star3.gif" alt="a green star" align=left>
You can rest safely in Leroy's, though you'll only want to do so if you have a fat resting macro in the PC version. It's useful if you have unconscious party members who can't sell their stuff, anyway.</blockquote>

<blockquote><img height=12 src="stuff/star3.gif" alt="a green star" align=left>
The Acapulco club is one of the places where you can encounter the "super loot bag" bug, or as it ought to be known in the C64 and Apple II versions, the "empty loot bag" bug. The reason why this happens is apparently that the club only has one loot bag associated with it. So if you play in one seat, leave the winnings then play in the other seat and win, you have two bags which point to the same contents. If you loot one, the other will be empty, but will still remain on the map. In the PC version you can get weird stuff from the remaining bag; see Addenda for more information.</blockquote>

If you disband a male character to go with the 3-legged (!) prostitute you get Wasteland Herpes. In the room to the northeast with a dead body, walk around the junk for a while and you should find 2 minor treasures. You can raise Perception if you're lucky. Use 2 TNTs (or a high Strength, 20 will do it) on the rubble in front of the enclosed alley to interrupt a gang meeting. The leader has an AK 97 assault rifle which I suppose would be a good weapon if you didn't go to the Savage Village.

<h4>Temple of Blood</h4>

Now, could this have anything to do with the Bloodstaff thingy, I wonder? Let's find out. Go to the building in the northwest corner of Needles. If you enter from the right you find the garage, but there's nothing in there but mutant scum (of the non-animated variety). Enter from the south instead.

<blockquote><img height=12 src="stuff/star3.gif" alt="a green star" align=left>
If each party member carries a Robe in their inventory (you don't have to wear them), you won't have to fight two guards in the hallway. You still have to fight random encounters, though. And you want to kill those guards anyway. So don't bring Robes (and I doubt you'll have found that many anyway).</blockquote>

Go into the room full of people and sit on a chair to find a word you'd better remember. You can also find this in one of the rooms to the left. North of there you can torture yourself in several ways: step on the electric floor, sit in the electric chair, or walk into the laser beam over the bed. Turn off the laser instead and you can recruit Ralf the bum.<br><br>

Return to the altar room and cross it. Raid the locker rooms and kill the gamekeepers. When you agree to play, you're teleported onto the chessboard (no way back, but it's no big deal). The correct path is 1n, 4w, 2n, 5e, 1s, 2e, 4n, 2w, 1s, 4w, 2n, 2e. Add that up and you get "30", which is the answer to the question. If you get it wrong you have to do it all over again, if you get it right you end up by a lake of blood. Everyone should have one of those.<br><br>

The way out is right behind you, but first let's do what we came here for. As you swim in the lake you can raise Swim to 2, but you'll also take damage from the water and from fish (but they don't bite through Kevlar vests). In the northwest corner there's the important password if you didn't find it already. Also if you go around the walls you'll find four groups of Glowing Slimes, I like those.

<blockquote><img height=12 src="stuff/star.gif" alt="a red star" align=left>
Walk up to any of the cave walls and bump into it repeatedly, and you get a secret message. The funny thing about this is that the game keeps track of where in this message you are for every square of wall around the lake!</blockquote>

On the island there are four Snipers to be killed. Use TNT on the gates to blow them down, or very high Picklock. With good Perception you'll notice a pair of pressure plates and be asked if you want to jump over them. Don't do it at first if you want to pick off the dogs from a distance. If you do step on the plates, it brings out an Auto Laser Turret which will fry your whole party at the same time. Ouch! Fight through the patrols until you get to the priest, then kill him and take the real Bloodstaff.

<blockquote><img height=12 src="stuff/star3.gif" alt="a green star" align=left>
If you have save state available, use it before taking any loot bag inside the walls - they are <i>extremely</i> random. You could get 2 LAW rockets and 7 Power packs, or 1 LAW rocket and 1 9mm clip. Remember that the contents of a bag is fixed when you first step on it, not when it is dropped or when you first view the contents after selecting a character.</blockquote>

<blockquote><img height=12 src="stuff/star3.gif" alt="a green star" align=left>
You may want to trigger the appearance of the turret sooner or later, because you can raise Assault rifle to 6 just by sniping it with single shots. If you have NPCs they may start firing full auto and actually kill the thing, though. The experience is sucky. This little exercise is perhaps only recommended in the PC version where you can rest up without having to go all the way to the world map.</blockquote>

Return across the moat and ascend the stairs. You'll arrive at an old hollow missile with an acid bath (don't step in it) and a guy who's been trapped for months (apparently the cultists have been as well. Just don't ask me why they designed their secret base this way). Tell him "motekim" and the way will open to an electric field which teleports you outside the temple. Now all you have to do is deliver the staff to the bishop.

<a name="vegas"></a><h3>Las Vegas</h3>

<blockquote><i>A cool breeze sweeps silently through the blackness and chills you to the bone. A lupine howl echoes through the darkness and comes at you from all sides. You feel surrounded and uneasy.</i></blockquote>

If you got here using the jeep, it'll disappear and you'll be deposited in the southeast part of Las Vegas (you can dump Ace now). The library is the blue building at the bottom right of the map.<br><br>

Cross the street to the west and enter the "small beat up building". The first thing you find is a beggar. If you attack or select chat twice you get to kill him, but he only has a pointless Visa card. If you give money (a mere $10) you can talk to him: known topics are "faran brygo", "fat freddy" (a password!), "robots", "max" (a clue!), "mushroom cloud", and "ace" (but not "covenant", for some reason). Now you know some of what's going on in Vegas. When you're done, go into the next room and fight a Slicerdicer.<br><br>

Generally, deserted houses only contain things such as a snake (Desert dust), spiders (Bug byte), a rat (Rabies), fuzzies, a centipede (Bug byte), scorpions (Bug byte), ants, turtles, another rat, or cockroaches. But you can rest in there if you have a resting macro.<br><br>

By the way, you'll encounter lots of robots in Las Vegas. Some are random (and annoying), others appear in large groups with different kinds. Use full auto on the large groups and single shot on the smaller random ones. Another Vegas feature is land mines. Stepping on them can raise your Perception and does no damage to people in Rad suits or better, so you may want to do this. Here's a hopefully complete list of where to find them:

<ul>
<li>1 beside the library.
<li>1 in the block with the Slicerdicer building.
<li>4 in the rectangle in the southwest corner of town.
<li>1 in the street just north of that square.
<li>1 outside the airport.
<li>1 just north of the racetrack.
<li>6 to the left side of the road southwest of the temple.
<li>4 in a row above the casino.
<li>1 in the street outside the casino.
<li>4 on or around the golf course.
<li>3 in the triangle east of Fat Freddy's.
<li>1 behind the building just southeast of the Scorpitron.
<li>1 in the L-shaped alley west of the jail.
<li>1 across the diagonal street to the west.
<li>4 in the triangle in the northwest corner of town.
<li>2 in the rectangle to the east of there.
</ul>

There's a doctor in the large blue square building on Flamingo Avenue, in the southwest part of town. There's another doctor in the pink building in the northwest that has one door to the north and one door to the south.<br><br>

On the golf course you can find some hidden items. At the top you will see a cactus on the middle of a straight line between two flags. Go two squares east from there and you'll get the message that something is buried; save before using a Shovel to retrieve it. Now, you <i>may</i> find that it is a Sonic key (yes, in all versions). However, it's more likely that it will be some RPG-7s; you'll want those instead, hence why you saved first.<br><br>

South of the temple in the central eastern part you find a RadAngel begging to be whacked. Northwest of there are a few Gundroids who guard a Sonic key. A bunch of 10 Cyborg Commandos in the northeast part of town also has one of those as well as a Kevlar suit. Obviously there's no shortage of Sonic keys.<br><br>

The jail is the building in the northeast corner of the map. Pick up a book from a bed to read a paragraph. Open the door to the jail cell and you can recruit Covenant (use Picklock to free him). Use Alarm disarm or Picklock to open the door to the room with the loot bag - or just use TNT on it, so you get to kill the people who come running. I don't know of any way to avoid taking damage from the electric floor.<br><br>

Somewhere in the centre of town where several streets intersect you'll find the legendary Scorpitron. It's basically a mean robot that wants to kill your party. It's also completely immobile. You can use it as a target to raise Assault rifle and AT weapon to at least 5, and probably Energy weapon as well if you have the patience to let it be until after you finish the sewers (although Brother Goliath in the Citadel makes a more docile target). When you're tired of the Scorpitron it helps to spend a couple of RPG-7s to get rid of it.<br><br>

Two houses west of the Scorpitron on the south side of the street (south and west from Faran Brygo's), there's a building you can enter to find an assortment of odd enemies, one of which is carrying a Proton ax. This is the best mêlée weapon in the game.

<h4>Spade's Casino</h4>

Enter Spade's Casino, the blue L-shaped building southeast of the golf course. Step on the empty spot by the bar and you'll get to see a guy named Crumb and get the password to Faran Brygo's place. When you come back the empty spot will be filled (more people to kill for later). You can gamble here and win consistently with Gamble 10, but the winnings are so small it's not worth the time. Don't even think about gambling if your Gamble is at 1, you won't win and therefore won't increase your skill.<br><br>

Open the door and climb the stairs. Ahead of you there's a creaky board (you'll be notified if you make your Perception roll). If your lead character has Silent move it seems you always avoid the board, so disband another character and step on it until you trigger an attack, which means you get to fight some extra enemies.<br><br>

In the room to the southwest you'll get a message that the table is rigged if you make a Gamble check, but it doesn't seem to do anything else. Kill Al and take some stuff from the table. The loose board disappears once you've opened either of the doors to Al's room.<br><br>

Go north and kill the Kutie. Open the door with TNT, then use Climb on the shaft to end up in a basement (use a Rope first if you want to be able to climb back up again). You can use a Shovel on the loose wall to the upper right to leave the casino. Walking around the rubble will raise your Climb skill to 4. Don't bother with the door, there's nothing in there.<br><br>

When you feel you've had it with the casino, kill everyone. The Guard Leader has a Kevlar suit and a Laser pistol; there's another Laser pistol and an Antitoxin in the crowd. Climb behind the bar and step on the chute to enter the wine cellar. There's stuff in the heap on the right and in the middle shelf. Go to the northwest corner and you'll find a hidden door (this will just take you outside). If you want to you can use up 4 charges of TNT to enter the fallout shelter, but I don't think there's anything you can do in there.

<h4>Fat Freddy's</h4>

This is the pink building two houses north of the casino. You'll know it because as you step up to the door, Thugs attack. Inside you can gamble (best place for it once you have a high skill, and you can raise Gamble to at least 12 here) and approach a door. If you give the wrong password you get boxed. Say "bird" and you're let in.

<blockquote><img height=12 src="stuff/star3.gif" alt="a green star" align=left>
You can get super loot bags here using the same routine as in the Acapulco club in Needles.</blockquote>

If you decline Fat Freddy's offer you'll be gassed. Unless someone in the party is carrying a Gas mask you'll be transported to the jail (with all of your equipment, conveniently enough). Use Dexterity to free yourself, then Picklock to free Covenant if you didn't already do that. You <i>must</i> recruit him to be able to open the cell door from the inside. If you did have at least one Gas mask, those who did not will be temporarily rendered unconscious and Freddy will attack.

<blockquote><img height=12 src="stuff/star3.gif" alt="a green star" align=left>
If you visited the jail earlier and killed Covenant, or recruited him and dropped him off, you'll be stuck forever if you're imprisoned. (Disk swapping may help.)</blockquote>

<blockquote><img height=12 src="stuff/star3.gif" alt="a green star" align=left>
There's a bug here in all versions of the game that can be exploited to resurrect dead party members. Just make sure they're not carrying a Gas mask when you refuse the job, and they'll go to UNC no matter if they were wounded or even dead before.</blockquote>

If you accept the mission you get $1000 and are sent away to kill Faran Brygo and return with the Onyx ring. When you do so, Freddy will attack and you get to kill more people.

<blockquote><img height=12 src="stuff/star3.gif" alt="a green star" align=left>
If you didn't get the ring from Faran Brygo there's one in the Guardian Citadel.</blockquote>

<h4>Faran Brygo's</h4>

This house is located two houses east from the Scorpitron, on the north side of the street. Enter and give the password "kestrel". Then go north and say "crumb". If you ask what you can do for Brygo, you get to read a paragraph and are then thrown out. In this case you can't kill Faran Brygo any more.

<blockquote><img height=12 src="stuff/star3.gif" alt="a green star" align=left>
If you tell the doorman either of the fake passwords "phoenix" or "clover", you'll get in, but everyone in the party will be afflicted with Wasteland Herpes!</blockquote>

If however you tell him what he can do for you, or attack, Brygo runs and you get to kill a couple of Guards. Go behind the desk and enter the passage. Kill the Lunatic. You can examine the room with the computers if you want (I think 50% is a closer estimate, but what the heck). Go into the room on the left and pull the lever to open a passage further ahead. Then go into the dead end on the right and a way will open. The way you came from has been blocked off, so keep moving right. An exit is at the top, but instead go down and blow open the door to the bathroom.<br><br>

Use Cryptology on the southmost wall. A passage will open to the vault. Save before taking the loot bags - you can get as many as 20 rockets from one of them, or as few as 6! To blow up the next door TNT is not enough, you must waste one of your newly acquired Sabot rockets if you didn't bring Plastic explosives. When you have the Onyx ring, leave through either exit and remember you can't come back in again.

<h4>Temple of the Servants of the Mushroom Cloud</h4>

This is the big blue building in the middle east part of town, with two doors on the south side. The password is "oppenheimer" or "einstein", or you can enter anyway if you say you have a gift and then say "bloodstaff". I'd blow down the doors with TNT instead, because this way you get to battle several groups of Temple Guardians, who shoot very badly and give lots of experience. Just auto-fire them until they lie down and don't get up.

<blockquote><img height=12 src="stuff/star3.gif" alt="a green star" align=left>
You can also find a camera to the left of the door and use Plastic explosives or Electronics on it... but this just causes the guards to attack, and you still have to open the doors with TNT (they'll close if you had already opened them).</blockquote>

If a door is described as "locked", use Picklock. You can raid one store for several Rad suits, another for lots of 7.62mm clips (good thing since you used up yours by the entrance). In the room with the suits there's a hidden door to the right. Further in you can take damage from electricity, heat or cold if you so choose. Using Electronics on the panel in the cooling chamber is bad, since it will just fill the central hall with radiation. There's nothing in the room with radioactive sludge, so don't go in there.<br><br>

Go into the meditation rooms to the left and kill everyone. Beware that Radiation Angels leave a contaminated square behind when killed. To the right you have a hospital, a library, and Dr Mike Scot(t), a not so good NPC. You might as well kill him, he's got a higher experience value than any other NPC except for Vax.<br><br>

Use 2 TNTs to blast open the doors to the north. Talk to Charmaine, tell her "faran brygo" sent you (if you say "fat freddy" they'll attack). Now you'll have go to Needles for the Bloodstaff. When you return with it, Charmaine will merely open a couple of doors. You can actually kill all the worshippers and still talk to Charmaine, but if you step on the square in front of her they'll really be pissed. If you bring her a fake Bloodstaff she'll get angry and you don't get another chance, but you can go and open the secret doors with a Sonic key anyway.<br><br>

Go into the left-hand side of the complex and kill some Techies. One will set off a "nuke grenade" even if you kill him first, so send someone with a Rad suit in to take the loot. The secret door is on the bottom left; follow the passage to the top (another secret door here) and go down.

<h4>Sewers</h4>

Whack the nearby cyborgs (triggering the stupid trap) and grab 1 Power converter and 1 Servo motor. Use a Rope into the river to throw it across. Kill some more bots and grab 1 Rom board (you must empty the loot bag from the ambush to get this) and 1 Fusion cell. You can dig through the hollow wall to the south if you want, but you'll get down there eventually anyway. Whatever you do, don't step into the river; you'll be washed out onto the world map as well as catching Sewer rot.

<blockquote><img height=12 src="stuff/star3.gif" alt="a green star" align=left>
If you're playing the PC version you can rest safely (using a macro) while standing on a rope or inside a dug tunnel.</blockquote>

<blockquote><img height=12 src="stuff/star3.gif" alt="a green star" align=left>
It's possible to wade reasonably safely through the water if your whole party has Swim 4. A trick is to throw a Rope across the river, walk onto it and step repeatedly into the current to the left; this will eventually raise your Swim to 4 (perhaps not very useful, but satisfying). You can raise it to 5 by stepping into the swift current in the tunnel and crossing over to the other sewer map, but then you will get Sewer rot. You cannot get back the same way.</blockquote>

Use another Rope by the chasm (this time on the square where you're standing). When you meet the Centron Deluxe Models, fire full auto a lot. Pick up another Servo motor. Beware that Tronnosaurus; it has six attacks and hits <i>hard</i>. As you progress through the sewers, also pick up laser weapons and use them to fire single shots at cyborgs (providing you raised Energy weapon to 1 in the library first) and you can easily go up a couple of skill levels. The wall to the southeast in this part of the sewers can be dug through (TNT or a high Strength will do it if you forgot your Shovel). Leave the map to the far right.<br><br>

A Cyborg has a Kevlar suit to be looted. A nearby cache with Power packs has a stupid trap on it. The unobvious way forward is in the top left corner. Pick up a Servo motor and a Chainsaw in the next area, and there's a stupid kind of spike trap that's triggered only if you use any skill on that square, not if you walk there. Now it's time to dig again, in the north wall between the patches of river. In this section you'll find an Android head.<br><br>

Return through your tunnel and find the next exit in the southeast corner. Another Tronnosaurus wants a whipping. Take its Rom board and Kevlar suit. Pick up another Servo motor nearby. Use a Sonic key on the door to open it, and finish off that last Hexborg to get a third Rom board.<br><br>

Finally it's time to use all that electronic junk. From top to bottom, use on each of the four squares:

<ul>
<li>1 Android head, then 1 Rom board.
<li>1 Fusion cell, then 1 Power converter, then 1 Servo motor, then 1 Rom board.
<li>1 Servo motor.
<li>2 Servo motors.
</ul>

<blockquote><img height=12 src="stuff/star3.gif" alt="a green star" align=left>
In the PC version I recommend you save before rebuilding the android, since there's a bug which can cause the last station to gobble several Servo motors without recording any progress. If this happens you can use the file switching cheat to go and get more (here or in Quartz), but remember to back up your original files.</blockquote>

You must finish the last three stations before completing the assembly at the head. Max will awaken and reveal the location of the Sleeper Base as well as Base Cochise. The door you came from closes permanently shut, while an exit opens which will take you outside Las Vegas.<br><br><hr>

<a name="sleeper"></a><h3>Sleeper Base</h3>

<blockquote><i>All around you, set off behind thick crystalline walls, are the blurred outlines of monstrous suits of armor.</i></blockquote>

You will find this base in the northeastern corner of the world map, scenically placed between the river and the mountains. Don't load up your inventories before going here, such as restocking clips after the sewers; there's quite a lot of stuff to carry away from here. Go into the room on the left for a Secpass 1 and some clips. One cubicle in the lower row has a Secpass 3 in it. Go to the northeast room, use first the Secpass 1 and then the Secpass 3 to open the doors. Use Picklock on the cabinet. Then go down to the corner of the room, but don't enter the corner square yet. Disband a character with high DX (if that wouldn't happen to be your lead character) and step into the corner. If you make a stat check you'll end up with 1-5 Power packs and maybe a Laser pistol. By the way, you can drop the Secpass 1 already.<br><br>

In the lower right room (use Secpass 3 to enter) you can mercilessly whup some spiders who are ferociously guarding books, and enter a library where you can learn Clone tech. In the lower left room you'll find a Warbot guarding one of those super-random loot bags, this time with a Laser rifle in it along with Power packs and RPG-7s. The enemies in this place are wimps, really.<br><br>

Onwards to level 2. Use Secpass 3 for the next five doors. There are medical facilities, as well as two "normal" libraries which teach Energy weapon and Cyborg tech. In the empty square room on the right you get to read a paragraph. The room on the top left is genuinely empty.<br><br>

Skip by one door. Open the next using Secpass 3, use Perception on the desk to retrieve a Secpass A (this is getting complicated). This card opens two doors on this level, to the computer console and to the clone laboratory, but for the moment you can no nothing here.<br><br>

Go to level 3 and use Secpass 3 on the first door. Use Secpass A to open the door to the lower right, then apply your leftover Rom board from the sewers to the door to the helicopter simulator, which can now be opened with Secpass A. You'll have to disband a character to enter the simulator which functions as a one-skill library for the Helicopter pilot skill (you must also pass an AG or DX check when entering).<br><br>

Use Secpass A again to open the door to the central room with a desk and chair in it. Use Picklock on the desk for 1 Secpass 7 and 1 Power converter. Move next to the wall where the blue corridor starts and you should find a secret door which cannot be opened yet. Use Secpass 7 to open the three doors on the left side of the map. The cabinet seems to always have 1 Power pack in it. Continue up (Secpass A now, for some reason) and you'll find a computer with personnel notes which give some background to the game's plot.<br><br>

Now, station someone at the power computer in the northeast corner (Secpass 3) and send the others to the blue corridor. Turn power on and you can now use Secpass A to enter the corridor. The zigzag pattern on the floor shows that your crew will be zapped if you step on it, so shift to your lone character and turn power off (they must have synchronized their watches or something). Walk your party across the shiny floor, turn power on, open the door (Secpass 3). The next bit with only one trapped square may not look so dangerous, but it is, so repeat the procedure. When you've opened the last door (Secpass 3) you get to fight a few bots and open a door (Picklock or Safecrack 1 will do it). Your mighty reward: 1 Fusion cell and 1 Plasma coupler, none of which you need. Use the same trick to get out. That means we're all done with this level.<br><br>

Back on level 2 you can open doors with the Secpass 7. The strongbox thingy contains Rad suits. The store to the right of the armoury contains... lots of guns and clips! And Jugs. One must not belittle the power of Jugs.

<blockquote><img height=12 src="stuff/star.gif" alt="a red star" align=left>
Unless you're slightly deranged I wouldn't recommend going back and forth to a shop and selling off all the loot in the store. It's a lot of work and you simply don't need the cash. But if you're deranged I won't hold it against you.</blockquote>

Enter the room to the northeast, use the Power converter on the console. Go to the room with the previously inoperable terminal and determine the chemical levels need rebalancing. Use Clone tech on it, then choose "install manual outflow device". Use a Jug on the terminal and you get a Clone fluid in exchange. Take this to the room below, put it on the character you wish to clone, then disband that character and let him or her walk into one of the incubation chambers. Conveniently you get your Jug back. Since there are four chambers you can grow four clones at a time. After 2 days have passed you can return and recruit the clones providing you have room in your party (you get to enter a new name for them, too).

<blockquote><img height=12 src="stuff/star3.gif" alt="a green star" align=left>
A clone has the exact same stats and skills as the original at the time of incubation. It also inherits its behaviour from the original, i.e. you have no more control over a clone of an NPC than over the NPC itself.</blockquote>

The only place you (probably) cannot enter when you first get here is the armoury; for that you need a Secpass B from Darwin or the Citadel. To destroy the crystalline wall, use 4 TNTs in the same spot. Inside the room you will find:

<ul>
<li>7 Pseudo-chitin armors
<li>25 Power packs
<li>1 Meson cannon
<li>Random amounts of RPG-7s, LAW rockets and Sabot rockets
</ul>
<hr>

<a name="darwin"></a><h3>Darwin Village</h3>

<blockquote><i>A steel balcony stops you. Beyond is Finster's mad vision of Earth transformed.</i></blockquote>

Darwin should be approached from the north, because of the radiation, desert and all. It's not that big. There's a library, a doctor, and a general store where you can pick up one or two Fruits (hint hint).<br><br>

Go into the tavern, buy a drink and chat with the bartender: "chat", "finster", "base", "plague", "isolate". Then say "drink" and buy another drink. He will tell you to investigate the base, and you'll get different paragraphs for all of the above topics, plus you can ask about "password" and "metal maniac" (there should be an entry for Mad Dog Fargo as well, but I can't figure it out).<br><br>

If you walk into the room with people you can tell that they've been poisoned if you pass a Medic or Doctor check. Enter the building southwest of here, use a Chemical and a Fruit on the workbench (in whatever order) and you end up with an Antitoxin. Go back and use one Antitoxin on each poisoned guy to revive them. They're Mad Dog Fargo and Metal Maniac and they make worthy additions to your party. Since this is the only time you use Antitoxin, you only have to bring one of the Chemicals from Quartz if you got the Antitoxin in Vegas.<br><br>

The password to the black market shop is "cretin" in the C64 version, "cretian" in the PC verson. After two failed attempts the thugs will attack. Step over their dead bodies and enter the shop, which has several nice items: Chainsaws, Rad suits and Kevlar suits. You can also buy Howitzer shells and carry back to Needles to practice your mortaring skills.

<h4>Project Darwin</h4>

You enter the base between the brick walls on the south edge of the town map. To get inside you need a Secpass 7 from the Sleeper Base. You can open all the doors in here with that card, but there's nothing in the rooms. If you take the elevator to the upper level you can open more doors and talk to Finster. To force a confrontation with him you must free his prisoners, which you can basically do in one of three ways.<br><br>

The first two include returning to the lift and discovering you can now choose to go to the lower level. This will prompt you for a password, which is "proteus" (apart from the bartender this is found in a cell in Quartz, which is a bit far-fetched). Use a Crowbar to force open the prison door. A slightly different way is to fail to give the correct password three times, whereupon you're placed in the jail cell yourselves (conveniently will all your stuff etc.). Use Agility or Dexterity to get free and open the door from the inside with the same result.<br><br>

The third way is to take the long way around to get to the lower level. On the ground level, go to the strange teleportation thingy and enter Finster's landscaping project. Optionally use Climb to scale the hills and force open the hatches found inside the holes (a Crowbar works fine) to fight some mutants. At the far east side of the compound there's another slope leading directly into the lower level.<br><br>

You'll probably want to visit the red landscape in any case; in the lower middle part there's a sort of valley where you can trigger an ambush by Spawn Wolves and Spawnmasters. One of the latter groups leaves behind a valuable loot bag containing 2 Laser rifles and 1 Pseudo-chitin armor, which would be your best armour yet unless you already went to the Citadel.<br><br>

Anyway. Go back up to Finster and he'll throw a temper tantrum, so there's nothing for it, you have to kill him. Take his head. Go to the room on the right, give the head to your character with Cyborg tech (you have one, right?) and disband that character into the little room with a computer. Use the head there to hook up into a strange virtual reality...

<blockquote><img height=12 src="stuff/star3.gif" alt="a green star" align=left>
If for some reason you use the Android head from the sewers instead of Finster's head it blows up. You wouldn't ordinarily be carrying that at this point. If you do blow it up, you can still assemble Max using the head you get in the next part (assuming you learned Cyborg tech in the Citadel).</blockquote>

<h4>Mind Maze</h4>

Now this is fun. It's completely wacky. It's brilliant. In the first room you can read some messages by moving about. You can also take the cowardly way out, but let's not. Enter the coloured thingy for a mathematical question. The first answer is "32", the second is "512".<br><br>

In the next room there's a monster, the Night Terror. You don't have to fight it, and unless you have exceptional mêlée skills I don't really recommend it; sure, it's worth 64,000 experience points (which translates to several ranks) if you beat it with the Proton ax, but I suspect it has about 32,000 hit points as well.<br><br>

The next answer is "20" (though I must confess I don't know why). If you get it wrong you'll be told the correct answer. In the room below you'll be teleported around. Keep moving until Finster starts harassing you in the corner, then use IQ on your current square repeatedly until you end up in the lower left corner. Walk over to the exit. Type "finster" to proceed. Use IQ or Forgery on the web to make it disappear (Bureaucracy, to my great disappointment, doesn't work, but a high Strength does). The next answer is "nothing".<br><br>

Next, baseball. I don't pretend to know how the hell baseball works. You can hit a home run, which means you skip to the next part of the virtual challenge. You can strike out, in case you end up in the showers. You can hit a single, in which case you can just step back and try again. Or you can hit a double or triple, in which case you move on to the next challenge if you have the Silent move skill, or are gunned down and go to the showers if you don't. In the latter case, use Charisma or Confidence until the coach lets you out and you're transported across the chasm.<br><br>

When you've come this far there's no going back! You can use Strength on these webs, or using TNT is probably quicker. You'll have to kill one Android before entering the enclosure from the upper right and finishing another. Take their stuff. Go north, run towards the Finster and two more appear. Kill them all, take the Android head and answer the next question with "iceberg".<br><br>

Next you're presented with a dilemma. I don't think it matters which way you go. You end up in a small room where you can bump the walls for little philosophical tidbits. Use IQ repeatedly to get out. Finster will get mad and try to fireball you, and you'll have to kill him one final time. Strangely enough you get a quite physical Secpass B to take away from the virtual experience.<br><br><hr>

<a name="citadel"></a><h3>Guardian Citadel</h3>

<blockquote><i>This is a workbench that looks perfect for fixing all sorts of broken appliances, like toasters!</i></blockquote>

This is one of the first places you come across, but probably one of the last areas you'll tackle in the game. If you move close to the Citadel there will be hostiles on the battlements. If you're low-ranked, you can't hurt them and they can hurt you (the game even tells you as much). If you're high-ranked they'll probably run away instead, and you can happily shoot them down with rockets (one LAW rocket should be enough for each and you should have lots and lots even if you haven't been to Sleeper One). Luckily there are no random encounters in here.<br><br>

Brother Goliath is another of those stationary critters that are excellent for target practice. You can raise Assault rifle and Energy weapon to 7 just by taking single shots at him from two squares' distance. For some reason I found it difficult to raise Brawling by pummelling him with things (and he hits back!), but a trick is to buy lots of Spears in Quartz and toss them at him, which will eventually raise Brawling to 7 as well. Kill him and take his Pulsar key when you're done.<br><br>

You can use TNT on the "weak" walls in the center, but use two TNTs on the gates instead to prompt the arrival of three more groups of monks. Go left and right and clean out the place. In the museum, use Picklock on the cases for 1 Quasar key, 1 Grazer bat fetish and 1 Broken toaster plus some junk. There are some monks skulking in the dining hall, and you get the Ion beamer from Brother Austin on the left. Safecrack will open the door to the armoury with guns and ammo. If you empty the bag with Power packs you'll trigger a trap which will demolish the room (destroying the other bag if it's still there) when you try to move. Bomb disarm doesn't seem to prevent this. I still recommend doing it, for it causes more monks to show up.<br><br>

The next part may be slightly easier if you take the door from the kitchen instead of going up the main hallway. Pick the doors to the cells and kill their inhabitants. One of them will leave a "corpse" behind when you've taken the loot bag. Use first Perception and then Bomb disarm on it, and if done right you end up with 1 Onyx ring and lots of Plastic explosives.<br><br>

Open the door to the shrine on the left, kill the priestesses, then use Perception on the triptych to gain a Blackstar key. In the slightly larger cell on the right someone will throw explosives at you which can do a bit of damage. In the top left room on this side of the map there's a brick type of wall, with a bomb trap in front of it. You can raise Perception if you step on it several times, but only until it goes off (boom!). At the top is the entrance to the jail where you'll find a Proton ax and Redhawk, a sucky NPC that you can safely ignore.<br><br>

Go to the left of the main hall and check out the library to the upper right. In the northeast corner there's a shelf you can step on to enter a library that only teaches certain technical skills. In the upper dormitory you can fight a monk who then wants to strangle you (Pugilism check here). He guards a Nova key which you must have for later.<br><br>

In the lower dormitory there's a trap, a few bags with Power packs and a note with a password. The stores don't have much interesting in them. Go out into the hall, take the door to the left of the portcullis, kill the monks, then use Strength (20 is recommended) on the wheel to raise the portcullis.<br><br>

Enter "rosebud" into the terminal to open the doors. Each loot bag contains one Power armor as well as some Power packs (as if you didn't have enough of those). Go down and to the right, kill people, and continue. There are two things here: a helicopter and a toaster repair workstation. Bet you've been anticipating that the whole game through. Use a Broken toaster on the table, then Toaster repair, and you get some stuff and a (probably) useless Toaster. You can get more than one Power pack from each toaster if you want to feel better about carrying them around for so long. The four sets of items are:

<ol>
<li>Plasma coupler, Fruits, Visa cards.
<li>Nova key, Power packs.
<li>Pulsar key, Sledgehammer, Power packs.
<li>Plastic explosives, Engine, Snake squeezin.
</ol>

The locations of Broken toasters known to me are:

<ul>
<li>Topekan tent in Desert Nomads.
<li>Graveyard in Quartz.
<li>Museum in the Citadel.
</ul>

<blockquote><img height=12 src="stuff/star3.gif" alt="a green star" align=left>
The game doesn't discern between different Broken toasters, i.e. you get the first set of items for the first one whichever you choose and so on. Thus you need four toasters to get all four sets of items. At the moment I don't know where to find the fourth, but since the workbench stops working once you fix four toasters I suspect there is one more somewhere. How do you stick an Engine in a toaster anyway?</blockquote>

Open a hole in the fence with a Proton ax or TNT. You need someone with the Helicopter pilot skill to get anywhere. Use the skill on the chopper to unlock the seat, then you can take off (pressing Esc if you don't want to go). Going to Savage Village, Quartz, Needles, Las Vegas or Sleeper Base will just deposit you on the world map next to these places, as will choosing Base Cochise if you've already been there. Going to Cochise for the first time using the helicopter, however, will fly you into the location and actually have an effect on the place. This is continued in that section.

<blockquote><img height=12 src="stuff/star3.gif" alt="a green star" align=left>
The helicopter can only be used once, after that it will be gone. There's really no reason to choose any other destination than Base Cochise, unless you want to storm that place on foot.</blockquote>

<blockquote><img height=12 src="stuff/star.gif" alt="a red star" align=left>
If Sleeper and Cochise are not on your world map (which would be the case only if you've been using the disk swapping cheat), you can still choose these destinations. Going to Sleeper will not put in on the map, but going to Base Cochise will.</blockquote>

Return the way you came and go left, killing people as you go. Enter the room and use Perception on the desks to gain 1 Rope, 1 Secpass B and that password again.<br><br><hr>

<a name="cochise"></a><h3>Base Cochise</h3>

<blockquote><i>My mission? To repopulate the Earth with pure life once my minions have exterminated all other life. I will win.</i></blockquote>

This place is located at the top left corner of the world map and doesn't appear until you talk to Max. You must bring the four keys from the Citadel, and a Secpass B. You may want to bring a Rad suit, but it's not strictly necessary.<br><br>

There are groups of robots outside the base guarding some computer parts (1 Rom board, 2 Power converters, several Fusion cells, 1 Servo motor and 1 Plasma coupler; grab the latter if you don't have one). Use Climb to get up on the roof (using a Rope will facilitate this, but it'll disappear) where you can fight more robots. If you got here using the helicopter you'll start out on the roof, the robots will all be gone already and their loot lying about (it must have been very frightening when that chopper came roaring in and crashed on the roof).<br><br>

There are two ways to enter the base: either use Picklock/TNT and a Secpass B on the gates, or use TNT on one of the weapon pods on the roof and then lower down a Rope. You end up in a hall with two moving walkways going up and down. If you got in using a rope, use Climb on it to get back up again.

<blockquote><img height=12 src="stuff/star3.gif" alt="a green star" align=left>
If you want to earn experience, you can equip your party with Chainsaws/Proton axes, open one of the inner doors on the outside map and stand behind the other. You can then wait for random encounters which will pop up within whupping range.</blockquote>

Go north and talk to the computer: "chat", "finster", "mission", "base cochise" are valid topics. If you type "break" you'll fall down a chute and may be in trouble if you didn't bring a Rad suit, so don't do that (yet). Instead locate one of the hollow panels at either end of the gallery, force open the hollow wall with a Crowbar and slide down (both exits take you to the same place).<br><br>

Use Picklock to open the doors here. The forcefield will take you back up, the ladder will take you to the next level. Let's explore this one first. Round the corner and fire full auto on the Xenon Laser Cannons. Use the terminal to extend the bridge and cross. If you step off the bridge in the middle of the room without wearing a Rad suit, you simply die (if you cross the retracted bridge or walk on the edge of the contaminated area you "only" get radiated).<br><br>

In the room with machinery, go to the nearest terminal on the left and type "run". You'll get to choose a robot type. The first two will just attack you, but the admin type is actually an NPC named Vax, and a good one (comes fully equipped as well). You can use Picklock and then a Crowbar on all other terminals to smash them, but it doesn't seem to make any difference. For that matter, you can take a Crowbar to every security camera on this level to no obvious effect.<br><br>

If you follow the corridor you'll come to a roomful of Octotrons guarding a stash of 2 Power armors, lots of rockets (take five if you don't have any explosives) and Power packs. Now that you've extended the bridge, go back up and say "break" to the computer. You'll end up back on the Octotron map, in one of the empty rooms at the bottom. Just patiently go all the way back and there will be new robots positioned near the computer, leaving loot bags with rockets and Power packs behind. Each of the hollow walls will also harbour Laser Pod Blasters. When you've blown them away you have to use TNT to open one of the passages up again. The computer won't want to chat any more.<br><br>

Climb down the ladder. You'll face four rather simple challenges which involve reaching a console to open the next door. In the first, just disband a character with good Agility to cross the pipes (everyone will take damage if you bring the whole party, but Power armor will absorb it anyway). In the second room just move forward and avoid the mines that will pop up if you have a half-decent Perception skill. As you continue down you'll find some robots.

<blockquote><img height=12 src="stuff/star3.gif" alt="a green star" align=left>
You can rest safely in any of the first three challenge rooms.</blockquote>

In the third room there's probably nothing for it but taking quite a lot of damage (try a character with high Luck). The fourth room is the toughest, a "combat simulator" (what's so simulated about it?) with twelve Xenon Laser Cannons. Burn those Power packs, they don't get much tougher than this. Take the ladder down.<br><br>

Open the door with your Secpass B. Kill the sentries and use Plastic explosives to open the other four doors, despite them having card slots and all. Start by going to the upper left room, but take care, there's radiation all over the place. If it's between 6 p.m. and 6 a.m. you can navigate safely to where you need to go, though. Blow away the glass wall (Plastic explosives or a rocket) and use a Plasma coupler on the machinery. This will open the small room in the corner; go in there and use the Blackstar key on the cylinder.<br><br>

In the northeast room, use a Crowbar on the machinery at the top to stop the conveyor belt from shuffling you around. Use the Nova key on the cylinder.<br><br>

In the bottom right room with electronics, use Electronics on pretty much everything to lower the frequency of random attacks (I suppose). On the south wall next to a console you can raise Perception and Cryptology by noticing a sign, then use Electronics on the computer above this square until the squares go black which may raise your skills again. None of this is essential to finishing the game, however (and disabling the "cylinder closing system" does not stop the cylinders from closing). Use a Pulsar key in this corner.<br><br>

Finally go to the lower left room. If you're lucky you can raise Brawling (or Pugilism) to 8 by wrestling robots, or if you're not so good at that you'll have to fight Silver Stranglers. Whack the Fusion Octotron and use the Quasar key on the cylinder in the corner.<br><br>

Once you press a key to initiate self destruction, the small rooms will close. This means you need to divide your party into four groups, sending one into each room. Next you'll be prompted for a colour sequence; you must get the order of rooms and colours right:

<ol>
<li>Northwest, red.
<li>Southeast, yellow.
<li>Southwest, green.
<li>Northeast, blue.
</ol>

<blockquote><img height=12 src="stuff/star.gif" alt="a red star" align=left>
How to figure this out? Well, you were given a number for each cylinder when you activated them (the keys can only be used in one order). When you've used all the keys the message "#1342-666" pops up. The first four digits represent the order in which each cylinder must be used. The colours simply go in the order they're presented.</blockquote>

If you get it right the cylinders will open. You have exactly one hour before the place blows. Move your parties together as quickly as possible, since time passes for everyone while one group moves. It is possible to make it by taking the long way back, but you'll notice an escape pod appearing above the place where you entered this level. Use it and you end up beside the big mean computer. You can then leave through the main gate, or climb the rope if you used one. (There's something that looks like a chute on the right side of the computer room, but it just acts as a regular wall if bumped and cannot be opened.)

<blockquote><img height=12 src="stuff/star3.gif" alt="a green star" align=left>
Be careful when leaving the base. Remember that the game is saved every time you move to a new map, so if you take too long you may end up in a situation where you cannot possibly make it out in time. Using save state or making a backup at an early stage may be prudent. If you lose your entire party this way you won't get to keep playing from your last save after rebooting, your characters will simply be gone. (In the C64 version I'd recommend you refuse to insert disk 1 when the game innocently asks you to.)</blockquote>

If you made it out, you get to read a few messages and see some nice graphics. You can now keep playing the game if you like. Radio Ranger Center and you'll get 10 character points and 10 MAXCON in addition to any ranks you may have gained normally. And if you didn't make it out... well, you still get to see some graphics. :)<br><br><hr>

<a name="npc"></a><h3>NPCs</h3>

<blockquote><i>The woman spits on the ground but joins you.</i></blockquote>

Information and hints on NPCs include:

<ul>
<li>NPCs differ from regular PCs in two ways. One is that you don't get to decide which group they will target in combat, or whether they'll fire single, burst or auto. The other is that they'll sometimes refuse to trade away equipment or perform an action. If they do, just try again (so this feature is more of an annoyance than anything else, with the exception of Redhawk).
<li>PC Charisma is said to play a role in how obedient an NPC is, but I don't think it makes that much of a difference. I've never seen an NPC resist more than one recruiting attempt.
<li>When you disband an NPC permanently, make sure you use the pool cash command on someone else first. If you used the NPC as a mule and sold stuff to a shop there's a chance he or she is still carrying the cash.
<li>You can save the game (save state in an emulated game) to recruit and evaluate a new NPC even if you already have all slots filled. If they suck, reload.
<li>The level of a new NPC is pretty irrelevant. The highest ranked NPC is only level 10 when you find him anyway.
<li>Even sucky NPCs have at least one use, as mules. You can also disband them from your main party and use them as decoys to draw enemy fire.
<li>NPCs don't leave loot bags if killed. As a rule they also give very little experience.
<li>You can get most of the best NPCs pretty early in the game if you want to, if you know what you're doing anyway. Once you've got 2 Chemicals from Quartz you can go to Darwin and get Mad Dog Fargo and Metal Maniac, and for Covenant you just have to dodge into Las Vegas and push a button.
<li>It's possible to delete all your PCs in the Ranger Center and keep playing with an NPC-only party, if for some reason you'd want to do that.

<a name="combat"></a><h3>Combat</h3>

<blockquote><i>Farmers cheer nearby. Murdering the cute little animals has rescued their major food supply.</i></blockquote>

<h4>General</h4>

<ul>
<li>You get double experience for any monsters you kill in close combat, whether with fists or mêlée weapons.
<li>You will hit a lot more if you have 2 in a weapon skill than if you have only 1. At the beginning of the game you'll rarely gain skill levels for free, so you should start with 2 in your primary combat skills (Brawling, Assault rifle).
<li>Your number of mêlée attacks per round is equal to 1+Brawling/2 rounded down. This goes even if you're fighting with your fists (in which case Pugilism is used to determine chance to hit and damage).
<li>Monsters can run diagonally and you can't. Deal with it. They have unlimited ammo, too (but at least they don't use up those clips you'll be picking up later).
<li>Two squares which touch corners are considered adjacent.
<li>Every point of AC is significant. Getting those Leather jackets or Bullet proof shirts as soon as possible will help you in the beginning. After you get Power armor you won't be hurt a lot by anything except at Base Cochise.
<li>If your entire party is unconscious or worse, combat will end and time will pass until someone wakes up or everyone is dead. Those wasteland monsters are so very sporting! Even traps and hazards (such as the blazing desert) ignore those who are at UNC or worse.
</ul>

<h4>Damage and healing</h4>

<ul>
<li>A character who is unconscious (UNC) will heal back to a positive CON, and faster than the usual healing rate. In fact, this can happen so fast that PCs revive and get knocked out several times during the same battle.
<li>This coupled with the fact that monsters don't finish off unconscious party members can easily lead to a very weird form of area conquest which relies on your entire party constantly hovering around the edge of consciousness. Monsters will knock your PCs out but never quite finish them off, until you eventually wear the opposition down. Retreating to the world map and resting up just isn't worth it, because those points will just be quickly lost again and not heal up as fast as the "negative" CON points.
<li>However, it <i>can</i> happen that you face so many quick opponents that your conscious party members will always be knocked out before they can do anything like reload, fight back or run away, in which case you may have to admit defeat.
<li>A character who is wounded (SER, CRT, MRT, COM) will just get worse. If everyone is at SER or worse you lose the game.
<li>With Medic 1-2 you can help someone who's at CRT at best. With Medic 4 you can help someone at MRT. With Doctor 1 you can help anyone.
<li>You can use healing skills during combat.
<li>A diseased character will not heal. Being at UNC or worse and diseased counts as being wounded for the purposes of losing the game. Diseases can only be treated in a hospital.
<li>Desert dust and Rabies are the only diseases that actually keep inflicting damage, but you can use medical skills to keep them in check until you reach a doctor.
</ul>

<h4>Tactics and behaviour</h4>

<ul>
<li>A burst attack uses up 3 rounds of ammo and can damage more than one monster in the same sub-group. An auto-fire attack uses up the remainder of the clip (4 rounds required) and damages all monsters in all groups in a square.
<li>Grenades, TNT and Plastic explosives damage all monsters in a square. Rockets only damage <i>one</i> target.
<li>Obviously you should divide your attacks when facing multiple groups or sub-groups, unless there is an enemy or sub-group that is particularly dangerous and must be finished off at all costs.
<li>There is one exception to the above: When you have several PCs auto-firing a group, have them all target the strongest component of that group. If the targeted sub-group is gone by the time a character gets to fire, he or she does nothing that round.
<li>Dividing your own party does prevent monsters with auto-fire capability from spraying several party members at once, but monsters with extreme firepower (such as the Scorpitron or Auto Laser Turret) will get multiple attacks on the same character instead, so generally it's not worth the extra effort.
<li>If you walk around with a ranged weapon equipped and loaded, you'll automatically initiate combat with hostile critters as they come into view. If neither you nor the monsters have ranged weapons, however, combat will only begin when you step next to them. This means you can sometimes sneak through hostile territory more efficiently if you unequip any ranged weapons.
<li>NPCs may fire wilfully at other critters than those who initated combat, turning them hostile. This can be bad if that's another NPC you wanted to recruit.
<li>If a monster with a ranged attack wants to run closer, but can't (because there's some sort of transparent obstacle in the way), it'll just stand there instead of firing.
<li>Multi-monster groups with both ranged and mêlée attacks will always run at you.
<li>Monsters with ranged attacks will always fire on the closest group. If there are no conscious members in that group, they may not do anything. This way NPCs can be used as decoys while your PCs stand one square farther back, sniping.
<li>Monsters with ranged weapons may target (or spray) unconscious party members, but in that case will always miss. Monsters with mêlée attacks always target conscious characters.
<li>Monsters will sometimes run away if you kill too many members of their group, damage them too much, if they can't hurt you, or if you're just too scary. If you don't have ranged weapons you'll have to run after them and corner them (at which point they'll fight back). If you end combat and then come across the same critters, they'll run at you again if their previous retreat was just the result of a failed morale check.
<li>Animals don't seem to run away. Neither do the robots in Base Cochise, while the ones in Las Vegas do.

<h4>Weapons</h4>

<ul>
<li>Reloading a weapon eats up all the ammo that was in the weapon. You can tell a character to reload a full weapon, which effectively disintegrates a clip.
<li>Any unloaded gun can be used as a decent mêlée weapon. In fact, so can almost any item (like a key) providing your Strength and Brawling are good enough.
<li>If you find a weapon you're not going to keep you can still use up the ammo in it first. Sadly you can't scrounge Power packs from Laser pistols and the like.
<li>Although the 45 pistol may do a point or two of extra damage compared to the 9mm pistol, it's not worth it considering the minimal clips (this is sort of an academic question anyway).
<li>If you're using Brawling, get Chainsaws for everyone that doesn't have one (or a Power ax) when you get to Darwin (and remember, you can actually go there pretty early in the game).
<li>The Flamethrower cannot be reloaded unless you sell it to a shop and buy it again. You could say it costs $1500 to reload. Jamming a Flamethrower is no fun. I'm not really sure if use of the Flamethrower is governed by <i>any</i> weapon skill; you don't raise anything when attacking the Scorpitron with it.
<li>The Spear is really a Brawling weapon and <i>not</i> an AT weapon, even though its function is identical to the latter category. It's possible to jam a Spear!
<li>Use up Manglers and Grenades before you get to Las Vegas (if you're not simply selling them). Use up Sabot rockets before you get to the Citadel. Use up LAW rockets before you get to Base Cochise. In fact, Cochise will probably be easier if you forget about rockets entirely, simply because auto-firing with energy weapons is more effective.
<li>Power packs are limited in number; then again, once you finish the Sleeper Base and Citadel (primarily using assault rifles and/or rockets) you'll probably have more of them than you can carry on several journeys across the desert to Base Cochise.
<li>If you have a choice you probably want to equip your people with Laser rifles and the Ion beamer instead of Meson cannons, because of the clip size.

<blockquote><img height=12 src="stuff/star3.gif" alt="a green star" align=left>
The standard advice is to keep a Canteen on each character to prevent heatstroke. However, you never really have to go out in the desert except when going to Base Cochise, and even then you can take the helicopter. By selling off your Canteens in Highpool you free up 4 inventory spaces, and you can always buy them back if you ever want to walk to or from Base Cochise.</blockquote>

<blockquote><i>She's beautiful, and she glows.</i></blockquote>

These lists were primarily compiled playing the C64 version. There are some differences in the PC version, e.g. Rail Raiders use the revolverman animation, Marksmen use the rifleman animation, and it seems the female pics from disks 2 and 3 have been exchanged. I haven't verified that all the experience numbers are the same, but I know of only one instance where there's a confirmed difference, the Rabid Dog in Highpool (the experience value after the slash is the PC one).

Miscellaneous stuff.

<h4>Paragraphs</h4>

One noteworthy thing about the fake entries in the paragraph book is that almost every one that doesn't just contain some codeword has something in it which is very hard to take seriously. While it makes sense that the purpose of these paragraphs should be to obscure the real ones and not to actively trick the player, it could also be seen as a missed opportunity to instill a sense of uncertainty in the casual paragraph book reader/glimpser. I wonder if it hadn't been possible to skip the false ones and incorporate most or all of the real ones into the game (admittedly shortening most of them), if the book wasn't just intended as a crude form of anti-piracy device. Then again they probably had great fun writing it. After you've finished the game you should definitely read the book.<br><br>

Proper entries: 2, 3, 6, 7, 10, 11, 14, 15, 17, 20, 21, 23, 26, 28, 29, 30, 32, 34, 35, 37, 39, 40, 41, 43, 46, 47, 49, 52, 53, 54, 56, 57, 60, 61, 63, 65, 66, 69, 70, 71, 76, 77, 79, 80, 83, 84, 85, 86, 88, 90, 91, 96, 99, 100, 101, 103, 104, 107, 109, 110, 111, 112, 114, 117, 118, 119, 121, 124, 126, 127, 128, 129, 130, 136, 137, 139, 141, 146, 147, 148, 150, 152, 155, 156, 158, 160, 162.<br><br>

An entry which I think is real but don't know how to reach: 140.<br><br>

Fake entries (including a few Martian entries which do not fit directly into that story): 4, 5, 8, 9, 12, 16, 18, 19, 24, 25, 27, 31, 33, 36, 38, 44, 45, 48, 50, 51, 67, 68, 73, 75, 87, 92, 93, 94, 95, 98, 113, 122, 131, 132, 143, 144, 149, 154, 159, 161.<br><br>

Entries which are probably fake: 13, 123.<br><br>

Why-the-heck-are-you-reading-this entries: 1, 22, 145.<br><br>

The "Martian chronicles" fake entries (including a double-fake entry!): 42, 55, 58, 59, 62, 64, 72, 74, 78, 81, 82, 89, 97, 102, 105, 106, 108, 115, 116, 120, 125, 133, 134, 135, 138, 142, 151, 153, 157.

<h4>Loose ends and oddities</h4>

<ul>
<li>In Needles there's a message in the police station about a "bum" with sensitive information. Who wrote this, and for whom? Who does it refer to? Ace? It doesn't seem like Mort or Ralf has any hidden knowledge (at least none that is revealed in Needles or Las Vegas).
<li>Why shouldn't Ace and Covenant be able to get you in to see Faran Brygo? Why doesn't Faran Brygo have any reaction towards them?
<li>What kind of job did Charmaine have in mind for the Rangers in the future?
<li>Why does it take a strong character a lot longer to heal up than a weak character? Admittedly most RPGs have this little feature.
<li>When and how was Finster made into or replaced by an android? It can be assumed he wasn't always a robot, seeing as he was the first director of Base Cochise, which itself saw the birth of the first sentient computer. Is the "creator" that Finster refers to Major Harrison Edsel who worked at Cochise and designed the computer?
<li>Is the Bloodstaff supposed to do anything except drain blood? You'd think so given that everyone wants it so badly. However, the fanatic you meet in downtown Needles has had the staff used on him but is still alive, and seemingly still faithful to the Mushroom Church. And why is Bill Dugan (of the blood cultists) missing from his office, when it's the second-in-command mushroomer who went missing in downtown Needles (and then turned up dead, killed with the Bloodstaff)? Could it be that the two cults got mixed up in either or both of these cases?
<li>What is the significance of character nationality, if any?
<li>Where is the fourth Broken toaster, if there is one?
<li>Why don't you get Rabies from being bitten by the Rabid Dog, or Desert dust from being bitten by the Glowviper ("the most deadly snake in the desert")?
<li>Can you get anything useful out of Head Crusher? What other unknown dialogue topics are there?
<li>What can Bureaucracy be used for, if anything? Are there more uses for skills such as Forgery, Metallurgy and Alarm Disarm?
</ul>

<h4>Version differences</h4>

<ul>
<li>If you talk to the guy in the men's room in Quartz and tell him "gang", he'll give different addresses in the C64 and PC versions. In the C64 version he says Target Trail, which is where the Stagecoach Inn is, on the PC he says Devastation Row, which is the location of the hideout.
<li>The password to the black market in Darwin doesn't match the paragraph book in the C64 version, but was fixed in the PC version.
<li>The super loot bag and disappearing shop bugs only happen in the PC version.
<li>The mysterious Combat Shooting skill only exists in the PC version.
</ul>

<h4>Cheats</h4>

<b>Disk swapping (C64, Apple II):</b> This cheat takes advantage of the way the game is saved. Since your party is primarily saved on disk 1, any other disk can easily be exchanged with a pristine or used copy of the same disk without affecting your party stats (disk 1 can be reset as well, but this is done a little differently). The most basic way of exploiting this is to make forays into copies of the original disks, killing things, grabbing equipment and possibly even hiring multiple copies of the same NPC. Keep backups of your "real" game disks to eat your cake and have it too. To get duplicates of items and ammo, play until you have a disk with one or more easily accessible and untouched loot bags of plentiful stuff (e.g. the Citadel for Power armor, a Proton ax and near unlimited Power packs). Leave the map so that it's saved. Now whenever you enter a map on this disk, use that copy; when leaving a map, insert a dummy copy of the same disk. You can then pick up the loot as many times as you like. To replace the contents of disk 1, enter the Ranger Center or some location on another disk with your party, then insert the alternate version of disk 1 before leaving. Note that Sleeper and Cochise will disappear from the map if you put in a virgin copy of disk 1, so you have to go through the Vegas sewers again if you want to visit them (unless you swap back to your original disk 1, of course). Here's what each disk contains:

<ul>
<li>Disk 1: The world map and all the early minor locations.
<li>Disk 2: Quartz and Needles.
<li>Disk 3: Las Vegas and the Citadel.
<li>Disk 4: Sleeper, Darwin and Cochise.
</ul>

<b>File swapping (PC):</b> The principle is the same: the game is saved in two files which can be exchanged for untouched versions to reset areas. One difference is that your party will be saved in either file depending on which location it's currently in; resetting that file will also reset your party, but resetting the other file will leave your party untouched. There is a utility by Jeremy Reaban which will let you save your party in a separate file which can then be reintegrated with the map files after you exchange one or both. It's recommended that you only do this when your party is on the world map (someone reported being stuck inside Base Cochise after a file reset). Game1 has the contents of disks 1 and 2 of the C64 version, Game2 has the other two.<br><br>

<b>Super loot bags (PC):</b> There are three known places where you can do this: the ghost chair in the Stagecoach Inn, the Acapulco club, and Fat Freddy's casino. Once you get two loot bags that point to the same memory address, empty one, then view the inventory of one of your characters (but you don't need to drop an item, as is sometimes said). When you go to examine the other bag it will seem empty, but press K to scroll down and you'll be presented with a weird list of stuff. Navigating this list can be tricky, and you will sometimes have to press Enter or Esc to get anywhere. Stuff to look for includes Pseudo-chitin armor, Ion beamers, Proton axes, RPG-7s, some quest items and the Red Ryder, a very powerful rifle that uses 7.62mm clips and does about 700 points of damage with each hit (enough to kill all but the very toughest enemies in the game). There will also be nonsensical items such as "Russian", "Female" and weird strings of text which can mess up the screen. One of the latter beginning with the word "NAME" has reportedly been used as a very powerful suit of armour; this didn't work for me, although at one point I could use it as an excellent mêlée weapon. After you stop viewing the contents of the super loot bag it may lose its powers; in that case view the inventory of a character again and you should be able to repeat the process.<br><br>

<b>The negative skill point cheat (all versions):</b> First you must play until you have a skill which costs 192 or more SKP to raise in a library (happens at skill level 6-8). You must also be of high enough rank to buy another level, and have enough skill points to buy the first level in this skill (1-3). If you now try to raise this skill, not only will you gain a new skill level for free, but you will also gain a skill point, or even 64 skill points if the cost was 192. This can be repeated until the skill goes as high as your level will allow (or until you reach 127 skill points; in this rare case, spend a few points elsewhere). The two skills you are most likely to use this cheat with are Energy weapon (you'll probably get 6 late in the game) and Gambling (but in this case you won't get the huge initial SKP boost).<br><br>

<b>Endless skill checks (PC):</b> Set up a macro so that your characters do something repeatable that earns experience, such as trying to climb the rubble under Spade's casino, stepping over the creaking board or running up and down the window at Ugly's hideout. Weigh down the corresponding function key and let it sit there for a long while.<br><br>

<b>The faraway friend (all versions):</b> Disband a character you don't want in your party and put it somewhere relatively safe like on the world map (or, in the PC version, some place without random encounters like Highpool). Play as usual with your regular party of six or fewer characters. Whenever you want to heal them up (from UNC or better), switch to the lone character and keep pressing Esc for as long as you like; time will pass for your main party as well, but they won't trigger random encounters. The only time when this trick cannot be used is during the final stage of the game when you need four groups in Base Cochise. Of course, the game will keep asking you if you want to switch to your lone character during combat, and I doubt many players would be willing to put up with that.

<h4>How to finish the game in 12 minutes</h4>

OK, I don't really know how to finish the game in 12 minutes. However, I can tell you what stuff really must be accomplished to beat the game. First of all, you must assemble Max in Las Vegas to get Base Cochise on the world map. Secondly, you have to invade the Citadel in order to claim the four keys and a Secpass B. Thirdly, you have to infiltrate Base Cochise and use those keys. Well, once you rescue Max you can get to Sleeper Base, go to Darwin and get that Secpass B for some good stuff in Sleeper, to help take on the Old Order. But obviously you must already be pretty tough to fight through the sewers. So basically there's no getting around that you must walk around and kick monster butt in various places to gain levels and skill points, and then you might as well play through the whole thing.
