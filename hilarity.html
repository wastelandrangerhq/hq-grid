    Welcome to the funnier side of the Wasteland.  Granted, deadly mutated
    lizards, fatal doses of radiation and jammed Uzis in the heat of battle
    aren't what most would call "funny."  However, this page is dedicated to
    the lighter side of the desert wastes, as told by Rangers who've survived
    to tell--and laugh at--the tales.

    If it can make Covenant laugh, I'll add it to these pages!

We begin with a submission by the enigmatic "V" who submits this list:
</p>

<strong>You're a Wasteland Junkie if....</strong>
<ol>
  <li>You've been arrested for shooting somebody in your neighorhood because
  you didn't know them.</li>
  <li>You bring handguns to a family-member's funeral, because you're afraid 
      Slithering Ghouls are going to attack you while you're in a
      cemetary.</li>
  <li>You refer to your circle of friends as your "Desert Ranger
  party"..</li>
  <li>You're prone to kill gang members if they make comments on how you part 
  your hair.</li>
  <li>You offer bums liquor to get them to move the hell out of your
  way.</li>
  <li>Instead of calling the Psychic Hotline for predictions of the future, you 
  get the local homeless dude drunk in hopes he may have a vision</li>
  <li>If somebody's standing in front of a jukebox when you want to play 
  something, you end up shooting them and all their friends.</li>
  <li>You try coming up with ways to hit on bar waitresses by using letters of 
  the alphabet.</li>
  <li>When your redneck uncle is having a vermin problem, you and your friends 
      storm his pastures and shoot every furry rodent you come across with 
      high-caliber pistols.</li>
  <li>You can survive out in the middle of the Gobi desert for sixteen days 
  straight with only one canteen full of water.</li>
  <li>While visiting Las Vegas, you wonder why there's no tanks...and why none 
  of your friends have been blown up for stepping on land-mines.</li>
  <li>You actually play
      "<a href="telnet://desolation.org:7878">Desolation</a>", and badger
      Devil into making more guns from the game.</li>
  <li>You study the <a href="maps.html">Wasteland geographical map</a> and
      find flaws in it. (i.e. 
      "Quartz is in California...but why is Las Vegas northwest from
      it?")</li>
  <li>You're terrified of chess-boards, and yell "THIRTY STEPS! THIRTY STEPS! 
      STOP SHOOTING ME!!" whenever somebody asks you if you wanna play a game
      with them.</li>
  <li>Taking on a squad of five gangers is no problem at all for you... I mean, 
      you already kill entire temples of cultists, visit cities full of killer 
      robots, and wander around extremely radioactive areas without a Rad
      Suit.</li>
      <li>You have best friend named Snake Vargas.</li>
  <li>If you really don't like somebody, you kill them with a burst from an 
      assault rifle, and attempt to hook their head up to your computer so
      you can access their mind and kill them from within. Creepy, huh?</li>
  <li>You manage to rig their head up to your computer, but can't access their 
  brain because you have a low Cyborg Tech skill.</li>
  <li>Fighting a twenty-foot Coyote isn't all too exciting to you.</li>
  <li>You're arrested for damaging several water lines because you were 
      shooting at a sewage worker while lurking around in the sewers with an 
      assault-rifle.</li>
  <li>After being arrested for killing the worker, you use the excuse "I was 
      trying to find robot parts to rebuild my friend, Max!", and are promptly 
      thrown into a mental asylum.</li>
</ol>

Ranger Ken St. Andre of the Interplay Wasteland team, correctly notes,
"Qwartz [sic] isn't in California, you geographical illiterate.  It's on the
Arizona side of the river.  Las Vegas is just slightly northwest of it."
<p />
Well, thanks for that update Ken.  No hard feelings, V!

<strong>"Top 10 things to do to piss off people in Wasteland"</strong>
<p />
  10. Defile someone's dead relative, and claim you shot apart his
  tombstone because you thought you saw a Deadel.<br />
  9. While walking close to Darwin, "accidently" have a pal scout a
  little off to the side, to go check out that weird green glow in the
  distance. (muhahaha!)<br />

  8. Hire a three-legged prostitute to give a "friend" Wasteland Herpes
  on his birthday.<br />

  7. Accuse a kid's beloved dog of having rabies, and immediately execute
  it there on the spot, then ask for a "thank
  you" for saving him from contamination of hydrophobia.<br />

  6. Trip and fall in a stream, and immediately gun down anybody you see
  snickering at your misfortune, claiming it
  was justified.<br />

  5. While in Darwin Base, trip someone and make them land in the
  Humungous Coyote cage.<br />

  4. Tell everybody your friend is a hobo, and he'll have visions of the
  future, just to get some free squeezin's.<br />

  3. Take apart your cyborg friend and throw his pieces in the
  sewers.<br />

  2. Nominate your friend to deliver the "We Come In Peace!" message when
  you're about to storm the Citadel,
  convincing him that the flags are for the miniature-golf the monks
  play on weekends, and are no big deal.<br />

  1. Give someone the guided tour of Las Vegas...and immediately scamper
  off once you introduce them to the
  city's main attraction, the Scorpitron 6000 (with rotating
  turbo-plasma cannon! won't they be thrilled...)<br />
