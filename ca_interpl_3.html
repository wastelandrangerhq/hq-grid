<h2>Interplay announces free distribution of classic award-winning computer role playing game, Wasteland</h2>
<p>
IRVINE, Calif., April 1 /PRNewswire/ -- Interplay Entertainment Corp. (OTC Bulletin Board: <a
   href="http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=iply.ob&d=thttp://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=iply.ob&d=t">IPLY</a> - news)
announced today the release of Wasteland in a special 16th Anniversary collector's edition CD-ROM.  This title
is part of Interplay's recent exclusive agreement with its stockholders to distribute
for free a series of their best-selling games since the company's inception.
<p>
A role playing game set in an alternate future where nuclear war has devastated the population of the Earth, Wasteland puts the players in
control of a group of "Desert Rangers" who must uncover the secrets in the deserts of the southwestern United States of America.
<p>
Featuring state-of-the art graphics and sound for the late 1980s, Wasteland puts human Desert Rangers
face to face with killer robots, mutated desert creatures, and even hints of an alien invasion.
<p>
The re-issue of this game marks the first time Interplay has decided to release to public domain one of its best all-time selling games.
Phillip G. Adam, President of Interplay Productions, decided it was time for this re-release.  "Interplay has repackaged Wasteland twice now
in various anthologies, and couldn't be happier with their success."  Adam was referring to the Interplay 10 Year Anthology,
a collection of classic Interplay games released in 1995, as well as the Ultimate RPG Archives, which contained Wasteland as well
as the first in the popular The Bard's Tale series of games, released in 1998.  "Now, to thank our fans, and to celebrate Wasteland's
success, we're offering it again, by itself, free of cost, and with a mail-in coupon for a bumper sticker created especially for
fans."  The bumper sticker features a broken down Jeep with a caption that reads, "My other car is a broken down Jeep!"

Interplay Chairman and CEO Herve Caen had this to say: "April fools!"
