    <strong>"Welcome to the Wasteland.
    I hope you're wearing your flak vest!"</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
    Wasteland is a post-nuclear war computer role-playing game set in the
    post-World War III southwest United States of America.  Your party of
    newly graduated Desert Rangers will explore this desert wasteland on a
    mission of reconaissance for the Ranger Center, the last bastion of law and
    order left in the year 2087.</p>
    <p>
    As you explore the radioactive dunes and ruins of Nevada and Arizona's
    once-great cities, you will learn new desert survival skills, solve
    mind-bending puzzles, reduce desert scum into fine red mists with your
    AK-97 assault rifles and laser carbines, punch holes into robotic
    monstrosities with rocket-propelled grenades and proton axes, and recruit
    characters into your squad, all while watching your Geiger counter to
    avoid the deadly hot-zones.  You will uncover devious and sinister
    plots which threaten to destroy the precarious balance of remaining life
    in the Wasteland!
    </p>
    <hr width="75%" />
    <p>
    Greetings!  I'm Ranger Ben.  You've just reached my
    ongoing Internet effort to establish an online presence for the greatest
    computer role-playing game of all time (in my radioactive opinion).  Here
    I hope to preserve and perpetuate the fandom of Wasteland.  At this site
    is located what I believe
    to be the most comprehensive collection of Wasteland information, hints,
    maps, fan fiction, and files.  However, as Wasteland has not entered into
    public domain, those of you looking for a free download of the game itself
    will not find it here.
    </p>
    <p>
    Thank you for stopping by.  If you would like to send me an e-mail, visit
    the <a href="commcenter.html">Comm Center</a>.

    <strong>1988:</strong> Wasteland is programmed
    at <a href="http://www.interplay.com/">Interplay Productions</a>
    under the leadership of Alan Pavlish.  It is distributed by <a
       href="http://www.ea.com/">Electronic Arts</a> for the Apple ][
    platform.
    <!-- According to the Interplay programmers, the game shipped
    on January 27, A.D. 1987, "or thereabouts." Not true! Not sure who
    it was made this claim. -->
    Wasteland is also released for the Commodore 64 platform.
    The game is ported to the IBM platform by
    Michael Quarles in A.D. 1988.  (See image of IBM PC edition box
    cover, right.  Image is also a hyperlink to a bigger-sized image of
    box.) Wasteland becomes the number one best-seller of the year.

    Ken's caption for the middle picture: "In my humble opinion, this is one of the best pictures of me ever taken. I'm the guy
    wearing the leather vest and the brown fedora. Mike Stackpole, best-selling Star Wars novelist is in the black leather jacket.
    Alan Pavlish, chief programmer is the red-haired guy with the bandana. It was 110 degrees F. out there on the dry lake bottom that
    afternoon, and we were all dressed up in twenty pounds of leather and heavy clothing. Those were the days! This picture was taken
    in 1987."  [<a

    <strong>1988:</strong> Wasteland wins
    <!-- <a href="http://www.zdnet.com/gaming/Welcome.html"></a> -->
    <em>Computer Gaming World</em>'s Adventure Game of the Year.

    <p />

    <strong>[unknown]:</strong> Development of <a
       href="meantime.html">Meantime</a> begins on the Apple ][ platform.
    This game, originally thought to be a sequel to Wasteland, is never
    finished.  Only in 2002 was it made widespread knowledge that this game
    was not, in fact a sequel to Wasteland.

    <strong>1990:</strong> <a
       href="http://www.ea.com">Electronic Arts</a> releases a game that
    uses a similar game engine as Wasteland.  This game,
    <a href="fountain.html">Fountain of Dreams</a>, is set in post-war
    Florida and attempted to play off the success of Wasteland.
    With significantly smaller game replayability, plot, and scenario,
    this game nonetheless explores the scenario where not only the creatures
    have mutated, but you have, too.    (See image of IBM PC edition box cover,
    left.  That's a scan of my copy's box-cover with my name in lower right corner
    blurred out.  I bought the game new off the shelf, probably at Babbage's, heh.

    <strong>September, 1993:</strong> <a
       href="http://fazigu.org/~quinn/ghost/">Ghostwheel MOO</a>, a
    post-apocalyptic MOO heavily influenced by Wasteland, opens its doors.

    <strong>1995:</strong>
    Wasteland tours the computer gaming world as part of the
    <!-- <a href="http://www.interplay.com/games/10th.html"></a> -->
    Interplay 10 Year Anthology CD, a collection of award-winning Interplay
    games on CD-ROM.  (See image of box cover, right.)
    If you have this CD-ROM, then you have the "post-setup files"
    version of Wasteland.  You'll want to check out the
    <a href="wlreset.html">Unofficial Wasteland Reset Program</a> which
    simulates the setup.exe program, which allows you to reset the maps (and
    thus win multiple times with the same crew of Rangers).

    <p />

    <strong>September, 1996:</strong> In September of 1996
    <a href="http://www.yahoo.com/">Yahoo!</a> creates a hierarchy listing
    exclusively for Wasteland. It's moved around a bit, and who uses
    directories any more anyway, vs. a search engine, but still,
    its present location is <a
       href="http://dir.yahoo.com/Recreation/Games/Video_Games/Titles/Adventure/Wasteland">here</a>,
    and it looks like there's only one link left.  :)

    <p />

    <strong>November, 1996:</strong>
    <em>Computer Gaming World</em> magazine releases a list of the top
    150 computer games of all time.  They rank Wasteland 9th.
    Read the <a href="cgwNov96-review.html">review of Wasteland by
    Computer Gaming World</a>.  Additionally, a variant release of
    the magazine has a "CG-ROM" with demos and games on it, and the
    "post-setup files" are included.  Here are some <a
       href="cgwNov96-install.html"
       >tips on installing the November 1996 CG-ROM copy of Wasteland</a>.
    If you want to reset your games, try using the <a
      href="wlreset.html">Unofficial Wasteland Reset Program</a>.

    <strong>October, 1997:</strong> Interplay Productions releases <a
    href="http://www.interplay.com/fallout">Fallout</a>, a post-nuclear war
    role-playing game.  (See image of box cover, right.)  Look familiar?
    Yes, it's Wasteland for the 90s!
 
    <p />
 
    Also this month, <em>Computer Gaming World Magazine</em> distributes
    Wasteland again, including it on the CG-ROM bundled with their
    October 1997 issue.  Coincidence?  I don't think so!
    The files on the disc are the
    "post-setup files," which means you cannot reset the maps or characters,
    etc.  This time, they also forgot to include the paragraph book
    entries.  (You can find the complete text of the
    Paragraph Book entries at the
    <a href="underground.html">Wasteland Underground</a>.)
 
    <p />
 
    <strong>January, 1998:</strong>
    <em>Computer Gaming World</em>'s January 1998 issue has a Hall of
    Fame on page 370.
    Listed among this "Cooperstown of Computer Games" which "broke the
    records, established the benchmarks, and held gamers in delighted
    trances for hours untold," is Wasteland.  "Derived from
    <a href="http://www.stormwolf.com">Mike Stackpole</a>'s
    Mercenaries, Spies and Private Eyes, this is the definitive
    post-apocalyptic RPG," the article notes.
 
    <p />
 
    <img src="graphics/ultrpgar.gif" align="right"
      alt="The Ultimate RPG Archives" width="108" height="115" />
 
    Also this month, <a href="http://www.interplay.com">Interplay</a>
    re-releases Wasteland in a new collection of computer role-playing games,
    through their DragonPlay division (which was later regrouped as
    Black Isle Studios).  It is called
    The Ultimate RPG Archives.  (See image of box cover, right.)

    <strong>March, 2002:</strong>
    The Flangy News announces the arrival of a port of <a target="new"
       href="http://theflangynews.editthispage.com/stories/storyReader$944"
       >Wasteland for the Game Boy Advance</a>.  This has to be the best
    Wasteland hoax of all time!

    <p />

    <strong>April 2, 2002:</strong>
    Wasteland receives a bit of free press from GameSpy.com, in <a
       target="new" href="http://gamespy.com/articles/april02/rpgweek/rpg2/"
       >part II of their article on Computer Role-Playing Games</a>, by
    Andrew S. Bub.  Part II is entitled "Computer Role-Playing Games - Part II:
    Gold Rush &amp; Beyond."  Page one has the sub-heading: "SSI's Gold Rush,
    A Vast Wasteland &amp; The Underworld of Ultima."

    <!-- Meanwhile, in 1988 Electronic Arts released Wasteland, a
    post-apocalyptic RPG from Interplay. Perhaps inspired by TSR's seminal
    Gamma World RPG, Wasteland ushered in the truly open-ended play
    experience that resonates to this day in games like Fallout and
    Bethesda's Elder Scrolls games. "Wasteland [was a classic] for the
    open-ended plot," Zeschuk says. -->

    <p />

    <strong>June 13, 2003:</strong>
    Brian Fargo and his new game company, inXile, acquire the rights to
    Wasteland with the United States Patent Office.  Soon after, Mr. Fargo
    shows up at <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/wasteland">Snake Squeezins</a>
    to ask for comments about the game from its loyal fans.
    He notes the reason he didn't get the rights sooner was that Electronic
    Arts was sitting on them.  When they expired, Konami grabbed it for use
    with their Yu-Gi-Oh series, but they were kind enough to let him have the
    trademark back.  And the new Wasteland will be "darker in nature than the
    first one," and touts that it will be "very much an old school RPG that
    uses the skill systems, open ended nature of design, and puts the player
    into a world that is not black and white but shades of grey." <!-- Soon after
    joining Squeezins, he bails out as others were cross-posting his posts to
    other forums, and I guess he didn't like that. -->

    <strong>Fall, 2003:</strong>
    Interplay again starts work on Fallout 3 and calls the game "project Van
    Buren."

    <strong>December 9, 2003:</strong>

    along with it.

    <p />

    <strong>January 14, 2004:</strong> Interplay releases Fallout: Brotherhood
    of Steel, a Xbox and Playstation 2 console game very loosely based on
    Fallout's world, is released.  It's a third
    person shooter and reports are that it has lots of factual errors in
    portraying the Fallout world and doesn't really have much to do with the
    previous Fallout titles.

       target="new">Here</a> is IGN's article about the sign sighting.

    <strong>March, 2012:</strong>
    inXile Entertainment kicks off their <a href="http://wasteland.inxile-entertainment.com/">Wasteland 2 web presence</a>.
    Their blog is called <a href="http://wasteland.inxile-entertainment.com/blog/">The Wasteland Chronicles</a>.  Their forums
    are named <a href="http://wasteland.inxile-entertainment.com/forum/index.php">The Wasteland Survival Guide</a>.
    Brian asks me to moderate the forums.  I'm honored, and totally ecstatic to be involved.
    A kickstarter campaign soon followed.  They hoped to raise $900,000 USD.  They
    reached their goal in <a href="http://wasteland.inxile-entertainment.com/blog/2012/03/14/wasteland-2-is-100-fan-funded/"
       >42 hours, 30 minutes</a>. Final count is over 3 million dollars between kickstarter and paypal
    donations!  Expected release date is October, 2013.
    Pavlish, St. Andre, Stackpole, Danforth, and Dugan are all invited to be on the design
    team by Fargo.  Fargo also snags Chris Avellone of Fallout fame.  Awesome!

    <p />
    "Ok, I've read enough!  How can I get Wasteland?" you may be saying.
    First of all, before you ask, please note that
    I won't be putting Wasteland up for download on the HQ-Grid due
    to copyright laws;
    nor am I in the practice of pirating my original copy over e-mail.
    I hope you can get your own Wasteland original!  You <em>won't</em> be
    disappointed. Electronic Arts still owns the distribution rights
    even though inXile got the copyright on Wasteland back.  So... search <a
      href="https://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_from=R40&_trksid=p2488646.m570.l1313&_nkw=wasteland+pc&_sacat=0">eBay</a>.
   They periodically have listings for the game in one of its various incarnations.

   <!--
      <li>CDAccess.com periodically has in stock both http://www.cdaccess.com/html/quick/interp10pr.htm
      Interplay's 10 Year Anthology as well as <a
         href="http://www.cdaccess.com/html/pc/ultrpgar.htm">The Ultimate RPG Archives</a>,
      and they restock their supply periodically.</li>

      <li>Find a used copy by placing a want ad on the Usenet newsgroup <a
         href="news:comp.sys.ibm.pc.games.marketplace">comp.sys.ibm.pc.games.marketplace</a>
      or one of the other newsgroups with a "swap 'n' shop" mentality.</li>

    <div class="section" id="sect_free">Free Wasteland!</div>
    <p>
    Over at <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/wasteland"
       target="_new">Snake Squeezins</a>, the Wasteland Yahoo! Group, there
    was <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/wasteland/message/861"
       target="_new">a discussion in 1999 about whether Wasteland was freeware, abandonware, etc.</a>
    It was one of the greatest hot issues of the group's
    existence.  Heh!  Well, the fact remains that Electronic Arts has not given
    up its copyrights on this game, so to this day it remains out of the
    public domain.  If you feel EA should grant users permission to freely
    distribute this game, please read <a target="_new"
       href="http://toby.richards.net/wasteland.htm">Toby's Wasteland Page</a> and contact Electronic Arts.
    Let's not fool ourselves into
    thinking that it's free.  In summary, Wasteland is not free so let us free Wasteland!
    </p>
    -->

    <!--
    You can no longer get Wasteland legally unless you can find a used copy
    for sale on EBay. In 1997, Interplay released a Ten Year Anthology which
    included Wasteland, but even that is no longer available. Furthermore, EA
    shuts down any web sites they find that offer Wasteland for download.
    Please join me in my cause to persuade Electronic Arts to grant people
    permission to redistribute this game. There's no reason they shouldn't
    allow free distribution of this game since they aren't making any more
    money on it, and they never will. Please send a letter to EA asking them
    to release Wasteland by clicking here, or by snail-mail or telephone:

    Electronic Arts
    PO BOX 9025
    Redwood City, CA 94065-9025
    650-572-2352

    mailto:technicalsupport@support.ea.com?body=Please release Wasteland for
    free distribution on the Internet. The game is no longer available, and
    neither is Interplay's Ten Year Anthology. It is extremely unlikely that
    you'll make any additional money from this product. So I humbly request
    that you do post-nuclear gaming fans the favor of letting them freely
    distribute Wasteland.

    This site is the brainchild of one person, and is maintained by the same:
    me!  In my radioactive circle of friends, I am known as Ranger Ben.  I have
    played Wasteland on the PC since 1989 and got the crazy idea to put up a
    web page about it when I was introduced to the Internet in 1995.
    When not editing, revising, and writing e-mails about Wasteland, I
    work a civilian job as a software engineer for a retail software
    company.</p>
    <p>
    Special thanks go out to my older brother for coming up with the name
    for this site back in its infancy.  Also, special thanks to my younger
    brother who has won Wasteland more times than he can count, and as a result
    is one of my best sources for all radioactive things.</p>
    <p>
    And finally, the current look and feel of The HQ-Grid could not have
    been possible without the contribution of Ranger J. Tirrell.  Read all
    about his contributions to this site at the <a
    href="wlnow.html">The Wasteland Ranger HQ-Grid Site Graphics</a> page.
    </p>
    <p>
    Additional thanks go out to the multitudes of persons who've written
    with comments about and contributions to this site, including Alan
    Pavlish, Ken St. Andre, Liz Danforth, Nishan Hossepian, Mike Stackpole,
    Bruce Schlickbernd, Charles Weidmann III, Burger Becky Heineman, Bill Dugan,
    and the folks past and present from Interplay, EA and inXile.</p>
