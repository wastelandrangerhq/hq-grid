And now, some commentary:
<p />
My first game I made the mistake of not loading up on
Intelligence and choosing the Quick Shot trait, in
which you cannot target your shots.  I missed out on
many side mission-enabling dialog options and
combat-ending criticals, as a result.
<p />
This time (#2) was different; I also made energy
weapons a tag skill and put a little in at each level,
ignoring other gun skills in anticipation of landing a
turbo plasma rifle (which for a long while, Enki
couldn't reliably fire until she gained Power Armor to
get the minimum strength).
<p />
Enki managed to keep Tycho, Ian and Katja all the way
through the game (disbanding at times to keep them
safe), though Dogmeat exploded like a blood sausage in
Mariposa (the military base).  With her high stats and
critical percentage, Enki had 3 shots (or 2 targeted +
a reload) every round from her turbo plasma rifle
going into Mariposa, and so paved over Super Mutants
like ants, critcaling them nearly every time.  The
only she time died after that was at the hands of the
Master---rather spectacularly, of course---but on
redo, I tried the "sterility" thing to avoid the
firefight.
<p />
Enki's best 2 moments were fighting Deathclaws. 
That's when she connected Harold's hint ("Poke 'em in
the eye, or something!  Hell if I know." or similar)
with targeting their eyes.  Imagine her surprise when
she leveled one all by her lonesome with a targeted
shot from her handgun.  She also discovered that you
can squeeze out a few more exp in the lair outside of
Shady Sands by sealing off the cave with a well-placed
dynamite charge.  That was unexpected icing on the
cake.
<p />
Most memorable experience: critical hitting the
Lieutenant and watching the gore fly.  They spent some
time programming that one!
<p />
It was also memorable to pickpocket the head water
merchant and steal her Vault 13 canteen (no doubt
extorted from Enki's subterranean comrades).
<p />
Note to self: Tycho ROCKS with the Red Ryder LE. 
Don't bother giving him the combat shotgun; he can
fire the RRLE twice per round, and reloading is a
non-issue.  Ian is best with Erwin's rifle-handgun.
