and punches anything into nonexistence.

Among those who travel with Gen.Darwin are his clones Cactus Jack, Tommy
Hawk, and Gen.Roc.  VAX the android was too weak to keep up, so was given
his pension and disbanded in Las Vegas, to clear out the battery-operated
toy robots there... and to do a little gambling!  All's well in the Vegas
Wasteland!"
