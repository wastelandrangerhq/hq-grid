<u>Notes:</u>
<p>
This game I played was an experimental game to really test my guts. 
I started the game with three characters and took on Harry the Bunny 
Master as my first major victim.
I also picked up REDHAWK to see if I could stand to 
keep him, but i really couldn't and ended up getting stuck with him.
I also checked out a lot of small little things I haven't figured out
yet and figured them out (like where the metallurgy skill was used).
That was great.  I beat the game within 20 hours if it means anything.
It was my greatest game ever and I never cheated once.
<p>
I wanna make a special thanks to Dave 
Davis for giving me the idea of Davis the character, same to my boy
Jose Rivera and Sara Damron.  I also wanna say special thanks to White
Boy for getting me back in to the wasteland spirit.  Oh and a special thanks
to Ranger Ben for doing this for me.  I really appreciate it.
