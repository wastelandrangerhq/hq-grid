      Here we find the heroes of the Wasteland.
      </p>
      <p>
      This page is intended to serve as a hall of fame of sorts.  I started
      collecting the "end status" of character parties for Wasteland in 1991,
      shortly after my brother David won his first game of Wasteland.  We
      typed up the end status in Word Perfect 5.1, formatted it nicely, and
      printed it out for posterity on my high-tech dot-matrix printer.  When
      I started putting this website together in 1995, I thought it would be
      cool to convert the printout into a web page and post the end status for
      Rangers world-wide to view.  Thus this page was born.  Over time I
      started collecting and soliciting submissions of completed games of
      Fountain of Dreams and the Fallout franchise, too.
      </p>
      <p>
      Collected here are the character attributes, skills, various other
      statistics, and even anecdotes detailing the adventures of the
      characters of your finished game of Wasteland, Fountain of
      Dreams, Fallout and Fallout 2.  If you have won a game of Wasteland,
      Fountain of Dreams, Fallout or Fallout 2, and would like the end status
      of your character(s)
      listed here, just <a href="../commcenter.html">e-mail them to me</a>
      and I will post them... eventually.  Unfortunately, I have done a lot
      more collecting than I have done posting.  I have a big backlog.  But
      I pledge to get your end stats up here eventually.  So please do send
      them along!  Thanks to all who have sent in their end statuses.  I have
      not lost them.  They are in the queue!
      </p>

      <p>
      Note: Ranks denoted with ** indicate unknown rank.
      </p>

      <p>
      <strong>New</strong> this week: a Fallout 2 end status sent to me by
      Ranger Jax, a Wasteland end status sent by Ranger Grizzly, and a Fallout
      end status sent by Ranger Kearney.

         <p>
         The rank next to the player name corresponds to the number of wins
         they've completed for all games played, not necessarily the characters
         listed above.  Ranks are based on the <a
            href="../underground.html#promotionslist"
            >ranks attainable in the Wasteland game</a> (see "promotions
         (ranks), listing").  For groups of Rangers who've won more than once
         through (after single or multiple resets of the game), or for groups
         which used cheats to gain super skills / really high levels without
         multiple wins, it is noted.
         </p>
         <p>
         I've received comments from several Rangers that some of these stats
         seem wimpy.  To clarify, many of these stats represent wins from a
         group of characters their <em>first</em> time through the game.
         </p>
         <p>
         You can download the
         <a href="wles_template.html">End Statistics Template</a> if you want
         to insert the stats into an HTML file like some of the end statuses
         listed above.  (If you use the template, or give them to me in some
         other HTML formatted way, I'll likely post them much more quickly
         since I won't have to format them myself!)
         </p>
         <p>
         In Wasteland, one can print out the Ranger statistics by pressing "p"
         while in the game and with the roster showing.  This little-known
         feature of the game (which appears on the Command Summary Card but
         nowhere in the game manual) should help you to keep your statistics
         for posterity's sake, as well as for submitting them to The Wasteland
         Ranger HQ-Grid.
