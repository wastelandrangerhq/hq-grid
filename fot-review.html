         The following is a reprint of an e-mail I received on June 8, AD
         2001, by T. Richards.  It was so good I didn't want to cut and paste
         it for my Fallout page, so I decided to reprint it here.
         <p />
         <div class="section">Review of Fallout Tactics: Brotherhood of
            Steel</div>
         <p />
         Dear [Ranger Ben]:
         <p />
         I see on your page that you're requesting a review of Fallout Tactics
         in terms of its
         relationship and similarities with Wasteland. I've recently
         completed the Fallout Tactics game, so I thought I'd send you my
         comments. Please note that in order to avoid ambiguity in this
         message, I use the word "genre" to describe RPG vs. tactical,
         action, etc. and "theme" to discribe post-nuclear vs. fantasy,
         sci-fi, etc.
         <p />
         First of all, Fallout Tactics is not an RPG. It's a tactical combat
         game along the lines of Jagged Alliance, XCOM, and Mech Commander in
         terms of gameplay genre. However, Fallout Tactics does have some
         RPG-like elements: you do gain experience, which you use to improve
         your character; and you do collect new and better equipment
         throughout the game. But that is about all it has in common with any
         RPG.
         <p />
         Fallout Tactics' tributes to Wasteland are rare. We can only
         speculate about why this is, but I put forth the following
         possibilities:
         <p />
         <ol>
            <li>Fallout Tactics is not an RPG</li>
            <li>Fallout and Fallout 2 used up all of the similarities in
            their own tributes to Wasteland</li>
            <li>Wasteland is even older now than it was when Fallout came
            out, so fewer folks would notice tributes to Wasteland. They
            probably decided to make tributes that more people would notice and
            understand.</li>
            <li>Fallout Tactics was not programmed by the same staff that
            worked on
            Fallout and Fallout 2. The new employees at
            Interplay and the people at 14 Degrees East may have only been
            vaguely
            aware of Wasteland and its significance.</li>
         </ol>
         There are some similarities between the two games. But it is evident
         that most of these are coincidental, and have more to do with the
         switch to a tactical genre than with tributes to Wasteland. These
         coincidental similarities include:
         <ol>
            <li>You are affiliated with a lawkeeping organization in both
            games.</li>
            <li>You have a squad of characters in both games.</li>
            <li>You can return to your bunker/HQ to replace dead characters
            in both games.</li>
         </ol>

         The only real similarity that could possibly be a trubite is that in
         both games, you are fighting against an invasion of robots.
         <p />
         Fallout Tactics was released in March, 2001, and is the third game
         to make major contributions to the post-nuclear theme in computer
         games. This, of course, is my own opinion, but here is a list of the
         three games to make major contributions:
         <p />
         <ol>
            <li>Wasteland: the first [popular] post-nuclear comptuer
            game.</li>
            <li>Fallout: revives the post-nuclear theme, offering modern
            graphics, features, and gaming technology while retaining the
            specific post-nuclear ambiance set forth by Wasteland (there are
            many visions of what a post-nuclear world would be like--Fallout
            keeps the vision that Wasteland depicted). Fallout 2 was an
            excellent game, but it didn't make any significant contributions
            to the post-nuclear theme.</li>
            <li>Fallout Tactics: takes post-nuclear computer gaming beyond
            the RPG, and is the first post-nuclear computer game with
            multiplayer capabilities.</li>
         </ol>
         <p />
         Please let me know if you'd like any other Fallout Tactics
         information, and I'll try to help you out.
         <p />
         Best regards,<br />
