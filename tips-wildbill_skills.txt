		WasteLand - Developing your Skills :
			    (and Using the "tools")
		====================================
		==================================== by Wild Bill
						    -- 4/30/95 --

	Just visit a library to acquire basic (level 1) new skills.
	DON'T waste your Skill Points (SKP) acquiring higher skill
	levels at a library. Each higher level requires more skill
	points and "experience" itself will earn you higher levels.

	Higher Skill Levels can ONLY be reached with "promotions"
	for your Rangers, so "radio Ranger base" frequently in the
	beginning of the game for "promotions" !  The SKILL POINTS
	you distribute should be used to raise the Ranger's I.Q.
	and STRENGTH attributes. Later, improve any other weak
	attributes they possess - ie: Speed, Agility, & Dexterity.

	There are 34 different skills that can be acquired by your
	troops, but all skills are NOT available at all libraries.

	ALL skills are available with a "24" I.Q. Attribute, but the
	better skills require 3 SKP each.  It may be necessary to
	raise an I.Q. to "30" to acquire additional SKPs.

      * NOTE - it is NOT necessary for all Rangers to have all skills !
	The skills marked with a "*" are ONLY needed by ONE member of
	your group.  Skills marked with a "!" should be possessed by
	ALL members of your group.
      *	Also, you'll need 3 MEDICS AND 1 DOCTOR !

	MAXIMUM SKILL LEVELS:
	--------------------
		Fighting & Weapons - level "7", however there are rare
				     opportunities where a skill level
				     may increase to an "8", if your
				     skills are already at the maximum
				     levels !

		Other Basic Skills - level "6", however there are very
				     limited opportunities to use some
				     of the skills, so maybe you'll
				     only reach a level "2".
				     Bureaucracy, Confidence, Silent
				     Move, Alarm Disarm, Helicopter
				     Pilot, Toaster Repair, Cyborg Tech,
				     and Clone Tech are those skills !

		Medic & Doctor skill - "12" & "6" levels respectively -
				     details follow below !

	Included are a few tips to raise some skill levels quickly.


Fighting and Weapons Skills - are developed by battling the various
---------------------------   enemies encountered in the game. The
		      tougher the enemy, the higher the skill level
		      that can be reached.

		      Las Vegas contains the adversaries that will get
		      you to the "4" levels, then a robot in the center
		      of town for some "6" levels. Get your SKILL at the
		      library and the first of the Laser Weapons here !
		      Energy Weapon skill is for the Laser (Power Pack
		      ammo) weapons.  The Laser Pistols are best for
		      "target practice" to develop your skills.

		      RIFLE skill is MORE USEFUL than it appears. Use
		      M17 Carbines or M19 Rifles to develop your skills.
		      The highest fight/weapon skill level attainable
		      is a "7".  With a 5 to 7 skill level you'll have
		      fewer "misses" and inflict more "damage" !

		      BRAWLING and/or KNIFE FIGHTING is the best way to
		      get through most of the game. Conserve ammo and
		      get your experience (promotions) faster !

		      AT WEAPON skill is a waste. Manglers, rockets, and
		      RPGs are "one-shot" items.  IF NECESSARY, they can
		      be used with no "skills",  BUT TRY TO GET CLOSE -
		      maybe within 20 feet, to avoid some "misses" !

		      When fighting with Pistols or Rifles, you're only
		      going to fire a single shot. You'll inflict less
		      damage and kills take longer !

		    * When fighting with any Automatic Weapons (Assault
		      Rifles, Sub-machine Guns, or Laser Weapons) a
		      "burst" is "3 shots" and will inflict more damage,
		      but usually only on ONE adversary !

		      "Full-Automatic" fire is BEST for larger groups of
		      adversaries (5 or more) OR for really tough/brutal
		      adversaries - WHEN you're using a "less powerful
		      weapon" against it !

Medic and Doctor Skills - are developed by "healing" your "wounded troops".
-----------------------   Level 1-3 MEDICs are basically worthless, just
		      heal the "SERIOUS" until you reach a higher skill
		      level. You may be able to heal a "CRITICAL" with
		      several tries, but don't try it while "fighting".
		      Level 4-6 MEDICs are really the minimum levels
		      needed for the first half of the game. You should
		      have Level 8-10 MEDICs before Base Cochise is
		      attempted.

		      DOCTOR skill "1" is decent, but get to a Level "3"
		      as soon as possible. You should have at least ONE
		      DOCTOR with level 4-5 Skill before Base Cochise.

		      With 7 "promotions" you can reach level "8" MEDIC
		      and level "5" DOCTOR skills. With 11 "promotions",
		      you'll be able to reach level "12" MEDIC SKILLS,
		      but the "11 & 12" levels come slowly, so just keep
		      practicing !
		      You should be able to reach level "6" DOCTOR skill
		      after the 8th. or 9th. "promotion", but this also
		      comes slowly !

		      Entering back room in the Darwin Village tavern,
		      and finding the "poisoning victims" may raise a
		      low to mid level MEDIC skill (raise a "4" to a
		      "5") level.

** USING MACROS :  When you're trying to develop your "low level" MEDIC
   ============    skills on a "victim" or PICKLOCK skills on some
		   of the more difficult locks, using a "macro" will
		   spare you a lot of keystrokes and aggravation !

		   May also be used when GAMBLING - when you're
		   winning some money on a regular basis.

		   Press and hold the CTRL key and a FUNCTION key
		   (F1 to F10) to start recording. Enter the key
		   strokes necessary. Press and hold the CTRL key
		   and FUNCTION key to stop recording.
		   Then, just press the appropriate FUNCTION key
		   to use your skill !

Other Special Skills :
--------------------
      ! PERCEPTION -  Important to find "hidden" loot and clues along
		      the way. Use PERCEPTION when you receive unusual
		      messages ! Perception will reveal various booby-
		      traps just by walking near or over them, also to
		      find "hidden doors" and "locks" when walking by
		      them.  These may raise Perception skill levels !
		      Walk along the "skylight" in Quartz to quickly
		      raise skills to a level "3" !

      * PICKLOCK  -   There's locked doors and gates almost everywhere.
		      The first locations are relatively easy and should
		      open with a few tries. The experience gained here
		      should make other locations a bit easier. DON'T
		      get discouraged too easily. Some locks are really
		      tough and require many tries to open. You'll get
		      the "experience" just by trying. You should have
		      level 3-4 PICKLOCK skill when all of Quartz is
		      done. You'll need level 5-6 skills for the final
		      location !
		      A high DEXTERITY attribute may help, allowing you
		      to reach higher skill levels more quickly.

      * SAFECRACK  -  There's fewer opportunities for SAFECRACKing, but
		      some "vault doors" can only be opened with this
		      skill.
		      Here's where you may raise skill levels:
		      Quartz - Court House - 2 vault doors.
		      Hide-Out - by "finding" the "wall safe"
			         and/or "opening" it.
		      Sleeper Base-after the "electrified" corridor
				   on level 3, but don't bother, the
				   loot is not needed.
		      Citadel - Weapons & Ammo vault near the Grand
				Hallway.

      * ALARM DISARM - The locked door in the Las Vegas "JAIL", but
		      you can get more guards/loot if you open the door
		      with a TNT instead. PICKLOCK may open this locked
		      door and disable the alarm in the process.

      * BOMB DISARM - This is better, you can "rescue" a hostage and get
		      more loot when you succeed ! May also raise the
		      skill level !

		      Quartz - Stage Coach Inn - Front Desk, cabinet.
						 Also, in room # 20.
			       Hide-Out  -  rescue "Felicia".

		      Needles - in the "Ammo Bunker", back shelf.

		      Citadel - "bomb" on Guardian's body.

		      Savage Village- "booby-trapped" chest for loot.

      * SILENT MOVE - Necessary to "overpower the sleeping guard" and
		      rescue Dan Citrine.  With Dan Citrine, his father
		      will give you $ 1,000 before he "runs off".

		      Walking around the "rocks" (where Spawnmasters
		      and animals appear for loot) on the Lower Level
		      of Project Darwin, is the only place I've found
		      that MAY raise the SILENT MOVE skill level !

      ! CLIMB -       An important skill for climbing over barriers.
		      Although tools or explosives may provide you with
		      an entry, climbing may also get you through. A
		      level "4" skill is best to climb the slopes of
		      Finster's test area in Project Darwin, and to
		      climb to the roof of Base Cochise.
		      The "sand dunes" in southern Needles will help you
		      reach level "3" quickly and Spade's Casino will
		      get you to level "4" quickly - if you find the
		      right cellar !

      * ACROBAT -     The "sand dunes" in southern Needles will also
		      raise your ACROBAT skill to level "3".
		      Two "exploding doorways" at the Citadel may raise
		      your skill level to a "4".

      ! SWIM    -     Useful to cross various water barriers you may
		      encounter, but DON'T just dive-in in haste !
		      There may be a better way.  Some water barriers
		      can be very hazardous !
		      Swimming in the desert river will eventually raise
		      skill to level "6", but acquire some decent armor
		      first !

      * METALLURGY -  Is a wasted skill. Find a "vein of silver" in TWO
		      places in the "Abandoned Mine".  Use a PICK AX,
		      found in the first room, to get some cash.

      * CRYPTOLOGY -  IF you're NOT going to help Faran Brygo, but want
		      to rob him of his Cash and Weapons, you need this
		      skill to find a "hidden vault" in his Jaccuzzi
		      room !

		      One of the machines in the Security Electronics
		      Room at Base Cochise may raise your skill level
		      when you walk by it.

      * ELECTRONICS - One machine in the Security Electronics Room can
		      be used to raise your skill level JUST by "turning
		      the lights panels off", another will REDUCE the
		      "Security Check Interval".  EITHER MACHINE will
		      raise your skill level to a "5", but be careful
		      NOT to INCREASE the Security Check Interval !

		    * My "secret" solution for opening the "closet door"
		      and a few "cellar doors" in Spade's Casino AND the
		      "High Security Doors" in Temple of the Servants of
		      the Mushroom Cloud.  Why "waste" explosives or
		      "waste time" trying to use "strength" when the
		      ELECTRONICS skill will open the doors "cleanly"
		      and maybe raise the skill to a "6" level !

		      DON'T play with the Cooling Pump Controls in the
		      =====               Servant's Temple  ! ! ! ! !

      * CLONE TECH -  Necessary to use the Control Panel in Sleeper Base
		      to "make Clone Fluid".  Take the "Clone Fluid" to
		      the "pods" to make "clones" of your best troops.
		      Clone your rangers or best recruits, you can make
		      FOUR clones, but only add (replace) THREE members
		      of your roster of troops.
		      Making "Clone Fluid" will raise the skill level.

      * CYBORG TECH - Necessary to enter the "Mind Link" machine at
		      Sleeper Base to enter Finster's Maze. The game
		      can be completed without going through this area.
		      Entering the "Mind Link" machine may raise the
		      skill level.

      * TOASTER REPAIR - the "broken toasters" you've found can be
		      "fixed" for some good loot, TWO of the "keys"
		      you need and a "missing part" to repair some
		      equipment at Base Cochise.  These items are
		      duplicates, and can be found without fixing
		      the broken toasters.

      * HELICOPTER PILOT - There's only one place (at Sleeper Base) to
		      acquire this skill. REQUIRED to fly the helicopter
		      at the Citadel. A "trip" to Base Cochise kills all
		      the original robots outside the base, but you miss
		      the experience points gained by killing them.
			      Flying the helicopter (unlocking the seat)
			      MAY raise this skill level, but you'll need
			      a really high I.Q. to achieve it !
			      (a "30" does not seem to be high enough.)

      * GAMBLE   -    If you want to TRY any of the "slot machines" or
		      "casino games", be sure to "play" using a Ranger
		      with GAMBLE skill !
		      One of the original rangers and a couple of the
		      recruits already have this skill.

		      For any "casual" gambling - just to raise your
		      GAMBLE skill level, recommend a minimum LUCK
		      attribute of "15" !

		      For any "serious" gambling - to raise your GAMBLE
		      skill level even higher (level "12" is possible),
		      and "make money" playing, recommend a minimum LUCK
		      attribute of "20+" !

		      Just a word of caution, some games are better than
		      others.  The "Casino Car" at Desert Nomads is the
		      best (least expensive) place to start !

		      If you "recruit" VAX, acquire GAMBLE skill for
		      him.  His LUCK (LK) Attribute is already "40" !
		      Then try the "roulette wheels" at Fat Freddy's in
		      Vegas. (his skill level increases very quickly and
		      you'll be "making money" when you "play" !  With
		      only a single promotion to get GAMBLE skill, he'll
		      be able to reach a "6" skill level, but even then
		      he'll "win" money for you and "gain experience"
		      while he "gambles" !)

      * DEMOLITION -  using GRENADES as a weapon is probably the best
		      way to develop this skill if you so desire.
		      Clearing a blocked passage in the Abandoned Mine
		      or using the Howitzer in Downtown Needles may also
		      raise the skill level.
   
      * CONFIDENCE &  are wasted skills. The guard at the locked door, in
      * BUREAUCRACY   in the Quartz Court House, may open the door for you
		      and leave.
		      This may raise your Confidence OR Bureaucracy skill,
		      but you'll miss some CASH and one of the SONIC KEYs
		      in the game.
		      These skills MAY help you get past the "thugs who
		      are standing in the hall" on the second floor, but
		      you won't raise skill levels there. Get "thugs" to
		      be active, then find more "gunmen" and "loot" !

	PUGILISM   -  another wasted skill. Fighting with your "fists"
		      or bare-hands. Unless you want to acquire and
		      develop this skill, it's just as good to "beat"
		      on your adversaries with your "empty weapons" !

Other Skills with no apparent uses :
==================================

	FORGERY         -       ?  ?  ?

	SLIGHT OF HAND  -       ?  ?  ?

	COMBAT SHOOTING - This skill is ONLY available when you CREATE
			  additional characters at Ranger Center. There
			  doesn't appear to be any way to raise this
			  skill level through "experience", although I
			  really haven't played the game with any "new"
			  Rangers.

			  There's a limit of FOUR Rangers with the THREE
			  remaining slots "reserved" for the "recruits"
			  you'll encounter.

			  The four original Rangers possess the basic
			  fighting skills and several of the special
			  skills described above. Try not to let any of
			  them "die", but IF you lose them, create any
			  "replacements" at Ranger Center. FIRST TRADE
			  ANY WEAPONS and EQUIPMENT to another Ranger !
 
		       ** KEEP PRESSING THE "SPACE BAR" until you get
			  a HIGH I.Q. (17-18) AND HIGH MAX (30-36) for
			  your New Ranger. The high I.Q. gives you the
			  most SKPs to acquire skills !

			  A "15" I.Q. allows you to get MEDIC skill,
			  but a "17-18" provides you access to a few
			  more skills.

			  Most skills are 1 SKP each and available with
			  an I.Q. of 14.  Other skills are 2 or 3 SKP
			  each and require a higher I.Q.
  
				I.Q.     2 SKPs:
				---      ------
				 15  Bomb Disarm, Safe Crack, Medic
				 16  Cryptology
				 17  Metallurgy
  
				I.Q.     3 SKPs:
				---      ------
				 19  Helicopter Pilot (at Sleeper Base)
				 20  Electronics, Toaster Repair
				 21  Doctor
				 23  Energy Weapon
				 23  Clone Tech
				 24  Cyborg Tech
  
 
			  DON'T SETTLE FOR ANOTHER "WIMP" OF A RANGER !
			  TWO of the best Rangers I ever "created" had
			  these attribute levels -

				   14 -  Strength  - 12
				   16 -  I.Q.      - 18
				   14 -  Luck      - 10
				   18 -  Speed     -  7
				   14 -  Agility   - 13
				   13 -  Dexterity - 16
				   13 -  Charisma  - 15

				   16 - SKP        - 18
				   36 - MAXCON     - 35

	-------------------------------------------------


ARMOR offers a degree of "protection" from the adversaries:
==========================================================

	Leather Jacket - there's one in Highpool AND four more if
			 you "fix" the water pump. Your basic armor
			 until you get something better !

	Robe           - about the same as a "leather jacket" (junk !)

	Bullet-proof shirt - there's just two in Quartz. This really
			 isn't much better !

	Kevlar Vest   -  there's just one in Quartz and another in
			 Needles. The best of the "low-grade" armor.

	Rad Suit      -  "medium-grade" armor, AND will also protect
			 you from "radiation hazards" in the game.
			 There's two in Needles, also the "recruit"
			 there has a Rad suit and other supplies.

	Kevlar Suit   -  there's just one when you solve the problem
			 in Needles, but this will help you survive in
			 Las Vegas.

			 there's FOUR more in Las Vegas: Spade's Casino,
			 near the Jail, and two more in the "sewers" !

			 this gives you a "fighting chance" against many
			 of the robots !

      * Pseudo-chitin Armor - first of the "high-grade" armor. there's
			 seven in the "Main Vault" in Sleeper Base and
			 another on the lower level of "Project Darwin".
			 You CAN'T get to these UNTIL you've completed
			 the Las Vegas "sewers" !

		       * Conquer the Citadel and forget this armor !
			 IT CAN BE DONE with Kevlar and Rad Suits, good
			 Medics, Assault Rifles, a few Rockets and much
			 "resting" between "battles"!
			 Be sure to get the BEST Laser Weapons along
			 the way !

	Power Armor   -  the BEST there is !  there's FIVE in the main
			 vault at the Citadel. IF you haven't finished
			 Las Vegas - it'll be a "breeze" now !
			 there's TWO more in the vault at Base Cochise,
			 and the "recruit" there has a Power armor and
			 an extra Pseudo-chitin armor !

			 Get the Power Armor BEFORE trying Base Cochise!

	-------------------------------------------------


TOOLS and their uses:
=====================

	You should ONLY be carrying 1 Shovel, 1 Sledge Hammer, 1 Pick
		 Ax, and 1 Geiger Counter among your 4 Rangers. DON'T
		 BOTHER PICKING UP EXTRAS UNLESS YOU INTEND TO SELL
		 THEM.
	-------------------------------------------------------

	SHOVEL - gets you "buried loot" in Desert Nomads and the Las
		 Vegas golf course. Can be used to "dig" out of one of
		 the cellars in Spade's Casino and to "break through
		 walls" in the sewers.

	SLEDGE HAMMER - can be used much like a crowbar. This will
		 "break a hole" through the railing in the lobby of
		 the Stagecoach Inn and the walls in the sewers.

	PICK AX - used to get "loot" in the Abandoned Mine. Can also
		 be used to "break through walls" in the sewers and the
		 fence around the helicopter in the Citadel.

	GEIGER COUNTER - displays and sounds a warning whenever you are
		 getting close to a RADIATION hazard ! DON'T depend on
		 it, you're probably moving around so fast you've been
		 "poisoned" before you can react to it.  Hope you're
		 watching for the "messages" on the screen !

	CROWBAR - A TOOL that may be used as a weapon. DON'T use to open
		 locked doors at first locations - get the easy PICKLOCK
		 "experience" instead. May be used to open first few
		 doors in Needle's Waste Pit. BEST to open a "hidden"
		 panel at either end of corridor above esculator in
		 Base Cochise for easy/safe entry to next level and to
		 smash the DELICATE MACHINERY to stop the assembly line.
		 MAY ALSO be used to destroy the Robot Assembly stations
		 and Security Monitor panels in Base Cochise, BUT this
		 is just a waste of time !

	ROPE  -  There are a few places where a ROPE is required to get
		 to "new areas". Use a Rope and you'll have "something
		 to climb." and ROPE remains for future use.
		 Also a few places where a ROPE can be used to climb,
		 BUT the ROPE DOESN'T remain - CLIMB skill should have
		 been used there !
		 NEVER be without 2 ROPES among your Rangers, but better
		 to keep 4 Ropes among troops - replacing "used ropes"
		 at the first opportunity !

	PROTON AX - although primarilly a super WEAPON, this will open
		 the "closet door" and "break" the wine-cellar shelves
		 in Spade's Casino. Can be used to break through fence
		 around the helicopter in the Citadel. IF you're in a
		 "destructive mood", any kind of Axes destroy the trees
		 in "downtown" Needles  (sorry, Chainsaws don't work).
  
	GAS MASK - really unnecessary ! If you "chat" with Fat Freddy
		 and say "NO" to his "deal", you'll wish you had even
		 ONE Gas Mask.  The "clues" already told you NOT to
		 say "NO" to Freddy ! ! !

		 ----------------------------------------
       * BEFORE USING ANY EXPLOSIVES, TRY USING YOUR SKILLS AND
		 TOOLS FIRST !  THEN, TRY USING THE LEAST EXPENSIVE
		 EXPLOSIVE YOU HAVE.  About 2 TNTs is all you should
		 carry until the final locations !
		 ----------------------------------------

	TNT -    clear a path through the concrete blocks and junk that
		 block entry to the alley in downtown Needles. Get the
		 jerks and loot there. Quickest way through last doors
		 at Needles "Waste Pit", can be used on the closet door
		 in Spade's Casino AND the "strong high security doors"
		 in the Temple - Servants of Mushroom Cloud, and MAY be
		 used on final doors in Brygo's IF you get tired of
		 trying PICKLOCK !
		 BEST way through the Citadel's walls and Main Gate, the
		 final wall inside Sleeper Base's Main Vault, and the
		 "jammed" Pod Cover Hatches at Base Cochise.
		 If you "pry open" the hatch covers in the Project
		 Darwin "lower-level test area", you can "seal them
		 shut" again with TNT.

	PLASTIC EXPLOSIVE - Best way through final Four doors and wall
		 at Base Cochise.

		 Various ROCKETS may be used as "explosives", but this
		 is a "waste" of resources ! IF you really want to get
		 higher AT WEAPON skills use Manglers and Sabot Rockets
		 in your "fighting" !

		 SELL the LAW Rockets and RPG-7's, then BUY Manglers at
		 the Black Market in Darwin Village.

		    (*  =  not available unless you've sold the item !)
						     (sell)      (buy)
				RPG 7                 2,500     *5,000
				LAW Rocket            1,250      2,500
				Sabot Rocket            550      1,100
				Mangler                 250        500
				Plastic Explosive       150        300
				Grenade                  75        150
				TNT                      25         50
  
				Chainsaw                250        500
					(better than an AX for BRAWLING-
					there's only 2 PROTON AXES and
					2 CHAINSAWS "FREE" in the game.)
