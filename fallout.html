    <div class="section" id="sect_history">Fallout History:</div>
    <p>
    <strong>1997:</strong> 10 years after the release of Wasteland, <a target="_new"
    href="http://www.blackisle.com">Black Isle Studios</a>, the RPG division
    of <a href="http://www.interplay.com"
    target="_new">Interplay Productions</a>, released a post-nuclear role
    playing game set 80 years
    after a global nuclear war.  Sound familiar?  This game is Fallout, and
    has been heralded as the unofficial sequel to Wasteland.
    In fact, the inside flap of the Fallout game box (see right) begins with
    "Remember Wasteland?"  (Technically, since <a target="_new"
    href="http://ea.com">Electronic Arts</a> owned part of the Wasteland
    copyright, Interplay couldn't make it an official sequel.)  In this game,
    instead of controlling a group of Desert Rangers and recruits, you play
    the role of a vault-dweller who ventures above ground for the first time
    since the nuclear bombs fell.
    </p>
    <p>
    <strong>Fall, 1998:</strong> Interplay released Fallout 2, also created by
    Black Isle Studios.  This game
    picks up one generation after FO--in fact you play a descendant of the
    vault dweller from the original Fallout game.
    </p>
    <p>
    <strong>March, 1999:</strong> Interplay released their Adventure Hall
    of Fame, a bundle of six titles including Fallout.
    </p>
    <p>
    <strong>March, 2001:</strong> <a href="http://www.microforte.com">Microforte'</a> and
    14&deg; East, in partnership with Interplay,
    released Fallout Tactics: Brotherhood of Steel.  It is a
    strategy game that takes place between Fallout 1 and 2.  You play a new
    recruit in the Brotherhood of Steel.
    Before Fallout Tactics hit the shelves,
    <a href="updates.html#tactrequest">I asked readers to offer me the scoop about Fallout Tactics</a>.  Eventually I received <a
       href="javascript:PopUpStory('fot-review.html')">an excellent review</a> by <a target="_new"
       href="http://toby.richards.net/wasteland.htm">Vault Dweller T. Richards</a>.  A few months later, I received <a
       href="javascript:PopUpStory('fot-review2.html')">another great review</a> by Brotherhood of Steel recruit J. Edgell. <!-- Justin -->
    </p>
    <p>
    <strong>2002:</strong> Interplay releases Fallout Radioactive, a bundle
    of Fallout, Fallout 2 and Fallout Tactics, with a pen and paper RPG game.
    </p>
    <p>
    <strong>January, 2004:</strong> Interplay releases Fallout: Brotherhood of Steel,
    a console (XBOX, PS2) game that had questionable placement in the Fallout universe.
    </p>
    <p>
    <strong>October, 2008:</strong> Bethesda Game Studios, who had acquired the rights
    to Fallout from Interplay, releases Fallout 3.  To quote my older brother,
    "Best. Game. EVAR!"
    </p>
    <p>
    <strong>October, 2010:</strong> Bethesda Game Studios releases Fallout: New Vegas.
    Set back in Wasteland's old stomping ground, the PS3/XBOX/Windows game based on the
    same game engine as Fallout 3.
    </p>
    <p>
    <strong>2009-present:</strong> Bethesda releases several DLCs for FO3 and FO:NV.
    </p>
    <p>
    Editor's note: my involvement in the Fallout series has been relatively minor.
    I bought Fallout brand-spankin' new, but have only also played Fallout 3.
    But still, send me your tips, your <a href="endstatus/index.html">End Statuses</a>,
    and Wasteland comparisons for collection on this site. I am happy to host them.

    <div class="section" id="tributeswl">Fallout Tributes to Wasteland:</div>
    <p>
    Here are some tributes to Wasteland contained in the Fallout games.
    </p>

<table border="1">

  <th class="background">Wasteland</th>
  <th class="background">Fallout</th>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td class="tributes">Fix the water pump in Highpool.  (One of the earliest,
          easiest quests to solve.)</td>
  <td class="tributes">The first quest you are sent to solve is finding a water purification
          chip for Vault 13.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td class="tributes">The Red Ryder (a "Super Juvie") in Highpool appears and attacks you
      if you kill the Juvies who laugh at you when you fall in Highpool Lake.
      The Red Ryder is very easy to kill.  AND, if you use the "Super Loot Bag"
      you can actually get the Red Ryder gun.  (See the
      <a href="underground.html">Wasteland Underground</a>.)</td>
  <td class="tributes">You can find the Red Ryder BB Gun and the Red Ryder LE BB Gun,
      which do a whopping 25 points damage and have an accuracy of 95%
      at range.  Perhaps these kick butt guns are to make up for the fact
      that the WL RR was a wimp.  To find them, wander from
      hex to hex along the coast. You should come across "Bob's Used Cars"
      or something similar.  Behind Bob (he's a raving lunatic, BTW) in his
      shack, there's a footlocker on the left back wall (with a Red Ryder BB
      gun), and on the right back wall, amidst all the junk, the Red Ryder LE
      BB gun.  Worth it!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td class="tributes">Most likely the second place you'll visit in Wasteland is the Agricultural
          Center, a farming community having trouble with rad rats.</td>
  <td class="tributes">Most likely the second place you'll visit in Fallout is Shady Sands,
          a farming community having trouble with rad scorpions.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td class="tributes">The Mines.  Creepy.  Exploring it throughout gets you some experience
          and some silver, but some gas masks.  (Whoop Whoop)</td>
  <td class="tributes">Vault 15.  Creepy.  Exploring it gets you some experience and a piece
          of armor.  (Whoop Whoop)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td class="tributes">The Wasteland Paragraph Book has two different-ending story lines of
      paragraphs detailing the Rangers' journey to Mars to fight the Serpioid
      Invaders.</td>
  <td class="tributes">If you have the Explorer perk, you can find a crashed UFO with alien
      corpses (who carry a picture of Elvis and a POWERFUL Ray Gun)?  The UFO
      is near the blast crater in the south.  Muck about a bit for it,
      it's there, complete with the notice "Return to Area 51 if found."
      The cash is also near (or along) the coast.</td>

      who will introduce himself to you and suggest that he help you
      clean up the town of all the scum in it.  If you talk to him enough, he
      mentions that he is a Desert Ranger!  And eventually, assuming you ask
      the right things, he mentions that the situation between Killian and
      Gizmo reminds him a lot of another casino war involving a really fat
      owner in Las Vegas that his grandfather used to tell him about.  Gizmo, the
      "bad guy," wants you to kill Killian, the "good guy."</td>
</tr>

        <td class="tributes">Sleeper Base / Darwin Station / Base Cochise</td>
  <td class="tributes">The Glow/Military Base: certain similarities: you got to repair stuff and you got to 
      find the correct secpasses. And there is  large storage of weapons 
      and armor similar to the sleeper base (although easier to reach).</td>

  <td class="tributes">In Fallout, you can go to the Skum Pitt in Junktown, where the local toughs
      hang out, and a singer belts out modified lyrics to the song Head Like a
      Hole by Nine Inch Nails, a popular rock band from the early '90s.</td>

      Angela Deth, of course, is the name of one of the
      prerolled characters that was coded into every game of Wasteland.</td>
   <td class="tributes">
      In one of Fallout's random encounters, according to
      one ranger who reported having seen it in a strategy guide, you can
      encounter Angela Deth.  He thinks one has to play a character with very
      high luck and outdoorsman skills.  Perhaps there was another

      Lester Moore,<br />Shot in the head with a .44.<br />  No Les,
              no more.</p></td>

          One ranger reports that a better example of this similarity might

      on it.  These three numbers spell out the combination to a safe you
      encounter later in the game.</td>

      PC game Wasteland. It should play similarly with most of the same NPCs and PCs. The town layout is also similar so you will
      recognize most everything. I added a few things to round out the plot as a stand alone mission."

    ...but the map-code was bad HTML.  So, I scrapped
