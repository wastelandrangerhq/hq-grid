    <p>
    [<span class="red">April 18, AD 2012</span>] The Wasteland 2 Kickstarter
    campaign is over!  3 million
    bucks is now in the hands of inXile, compliments of the WL2 backers.  WOW.
    This site's primary focus will continue to be Wasteland [1] but I can't
    ignore the fact that Wasteland 2 is the buzz so I will attempt to cover major
    milestones of the sequel as well!  Oh yeah, <a href="#scorpy2">Scorpitron 2.0</a>!
    </p>
    <p>
    [<span class="red">April 16, AD 2012</span>] Holy smoke!  Wasteland is
    back!  And so is the HQ-Grid.  I've been really busy lately (ok, the past
    several years) with non-Wastelandish things.  But Fargo has brought Wasteland
    back, so therefore I must return to the HQ-Grid.  I've updated the timeline
    below.  But the most important news is the Wasteland 2 kickstarter campaign,
    which ends April 17. Read and rejoice!  (And yes, yes, I should have updated
    this site at the beginning of the campaign, but I've been busy on the forums
    and never quite got around to it!
    </p>
    <p>
    Updated: Main page, Comm Center, Underground, Fallout, and Meantime pages.
    </p>

    <p>
    [<span class="red">April 27-30, AD 2008</span>] Converted and house-cleaned
    the <a href="library.html">Gateway Library</a>.  Moved some information
    through the <a href="underground.html">Underground</a>.  Added three new
    <a href="endstatus/index.html">End Statuses</a>.
    <a href="RangerCenter/ranger.shtml">Ranger Center</a> is finally back!
    </p>

    <p>
    [<span class="red">January 23, AD 2006</span>]
    <strong>Content update:</strong> Added one Fallout End Status--my
    older brother's second win from 2003.  Added
    several commentaries dredged from my queue of e-mail and Snake Squeezins
    posts from 2000-2005!  Added Per Jorner's site to the Library.  Added
    chapter 5 (the "latest") of <em>Once Upon an Uzi</em>, the Wasteland
    Tale written at Tales From the Wasteland, to the Wasteland Chronicles.
    </p>
    <p>
    [<span class="red">June 22, AD 2005</span>]
    <strong>Design update:</strong>
    With this update I have finally upgraded the design of the <a
       href="endstatus/index.html">End Status</a> collection to the new style.
    </p>
    <p>
    <strong>Content update:</strong>
    I added six Wasteland end statuses (including two with Supreme Jerk
    characters), and one Fountain of Dreams end status, to the <a
       href="endstatus/index.html">End Status</a> collection.  I've got a
    bunch more statuses (WL, FoD and FO) waiting to be uploaded but I
    just didn't have the time to squeeze them into this update, sorry!
    Expanded the <a href="fountain.html">Fountain of Dreams</a> page with a
    link to a new Walkthrough/Guide/FAQ.  Added a quote from my fan mail to
    the main page (top right, under graphic).  I love fan mail!
    </p>
    <p>
    [<span class="red">September 20, AD 2004</span>]
    Added an endorsement of the <a
       href="http://www.spreadfirefox.com/?q=affiliates&amp;id=7291&amp;t=80"
       >Mozilla Firefox</a> web browser.  It's just that good!
    </p>
    <p>
    [<span class="red">August 29, AD 2004</span>]
    With this update I have upgraded
    the format of the <a href="hilarity.html">Recreation Center</a>.  Now
    accepting new submissions to supplement this page which I know could be a
    lot bigger and better!  Also, I <em>finally</em> finished upgrading the
    format of the <a href="fountain.html">Fountain of Dreams</a> page which I
    apparently last touched on February 26, 2001.  Yikes!
    </p>
    <p>
    <strong>Content update:</strong> Added some new <a href="fallout.html"
       >tributes between Wasteland and the Fallout series</a>.  Added
    some old (circa 2002) and new (circa 2004) commentary to the
    <a href="underground.html">Underground</a>.  Cleaned up the <a
       href="bin.html">File Room</a>'s links, and added the Wasteland
    Advance to the list.  Cleaned up the <a href="library.html">Links</a> page.
    Added a hyperlink from the <a href="meantime.html">Meantime</a> page to
    the <a href="underground.html">Underground</a>.  (Can you find it?)
    Added Ranger Gasmier's "Bunkers" <a href="chronicles.html"
       >Wasteland Tale</a> from 2002.  Updated the Wasteland History (below).
    Added a new link on the <a href="meantime.html">Meantime</a> page (at
    bottom).
    </p>
    <p>
    [<span class="red">May 6, AD 2004</span>] Thanks to those of you who
    wrote in to say that the e-mail address images weren't working on the <a
       href="commcenter.html">Comm Center</a> page!  This mini-update
    corrected that error.  (They uploaded in upper case instead of lower
    case, argh!)
    </p>
    <p>
    [<span class="red">September 4, AD 2003</span>]  With this update I have
    upgraded the format of the <a href="underground.html">Underground</a>
    and the <a href="meantime.html">Meantime</a> pages.
    </p>
    <p>
    <strong>Content update:</strong>
    Added a section on the front page to support the <a
       href="wasteland.html#sect_free">Free Wasteland!</a> campaign.
    Added a review of Fallout Tactics: Brotherhood of Steel and the entire
    Wasteland / Fallout series to the <a href="fallout.html">Fallout</a>
    page, as well as one new Fallout 2 / Wasteland similarity.
    Added new commentary to the <a
       href="underground.html">Wasteland Underground</a>.  Added an
    explanation for retracting a story from a Wasteland Chronicler to the
    <a href="chronicles.html">Reading Room</a> (see
    <cite>Fountain of Dreams</cite>).  Cleaned up and added some new links at
    the <a href="library.html">Links</a> page.  Added a
    <strong>bunch</strong> of new information about <a
       href="meantime.html">Meantime</a>.  Added some new entries in the
    Wasteland History section below (look toward the bottom).
    </p>
    <p>
    Also, although not (yet) part of the HQ-Grid, the <a
       href="http://bsc.edu/~bassaf/gnarly_postnuke.html"
       >Gnarly Sellers' Post Nuclear War Selections</a> has been updated
    with a few books.  If you haven't seen this list before, it might be
    worth your while to check it out.  Some of these selections were
    inspiration for the creators of Wasteland, Fallout, etc.
    </p>
    <p>
    [<font color="red">February 27, AD 2003</font>] With this long overdue
    update I have upgraded the formatting of the <a
    href="fallout.html">Fallout</a> page.
    </p>
    <p>
    <strong>Content update:</strong>
    I added some new tributes to Wasteland found within the Fallout series of
    games (Fallout 2 and Fallout Tactics: Brotherhood of Steel), and added
    an entry in the Wasteland History timeline for Fallout Tactics: BOS.  (I
    know this isn't a tremendously big update but I wanted to get it out all
    the same!)
    </p>
    <p>
    [<font color="red">July 29, AD 2002</font>]  With this update I have
    upgraded the formats of: <a href="updates.html">Updates</a>, <a
    href="bin.html">File Room</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
    <strong>Content update:</strong>
    By request, I updated the author of a few Wasteland Chronicles,
    Underground tips, Wasteland End Statuses, and other mentions of this name
    to a pen name.  If you know who it is, aren't you clever!  If you don't,
    let's just say this person wants to be known more for his other Internet
    efforts than his connection to Wasteland.  Crazy, I know, but hey, some
    of us are apparently professionals.
    </p>
    <p>
    Also, I updated some commentary (armor, operating system compatibility)
    on the <a href="underground.html">Underground (Wasteland Room)</a>,
    although I haven't upgraded the format yet.  I added links to the ongoing
    and some past home-made Wasteland games to the <a
    href="bin.html">File Room</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
    [<font color="red">May 14, AD 2002</font>]
    As you may have already noticed, not all pages on the new site here
    at wastelandrangerhq.github.io/hq-grid have been converted to the new format.  It
    would take me too long to convert the whole site at once, so I decided
    to transfer all the pages from <a
    href="http://bsc.edu/~bassaf/hqgrid">the previous location</a> and
    reformat them as I have time.  If you spot any bad links, please <a
    href="commcenter.html">let me know</a>.  With this update I have upgraded
    the formats of this, the main page, as well as: Site Graphics, Reading
    Room, Comm Center.
    </p>
    <p>
    Back when I was started thinking about reformatting this site, I issued
    The [First] Wasteland Ranger HQ-Grid Button Contest at
    <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/wasteland">Snake Squeezins</a>,
    the Wasteland Yahoo! Group.  See the
    <a href="wlnow.html">Site Graphics page</a> (nee <a
    href="http://bsc.edu/~bassaf/hqgrid/wlnow.html">Wasteland Now!</a>) for the
    details of the contest and the results!
    </p>
    <p>
    <strong>Content update:</strong>
    In my November 15, 2000 update, I inquired about <a
    href="http://www.interplay.com/falloutbos">Fallout: Tactics: Brotherhood
    of Steel</a>.  Thanks to those who have written over the months (years!)
    about this game.  If you have noticed any similarities between this game
    and Wasteland, do send them on over to me and I will be sure to post them
    at the <a href="fallout.html">Fallout series</a> page.
    </p>
    <p>
    [<font color="red">February 27, AD 2002</font>] Welcome to
    wastelandrangerhq.github.io/hq-grid!  This page and the
    accompanying flash animation (see <a href="index.html">index.html</a>)
    are but a preview of the new look and feel of The Wasteland Ranger HQ-Grid.
    </p>
    <p>
    It was supposed to be a new look for the new millenium.  That's right, I
    started working on this update in 2000 hoping to publish it in January of
    2001, but due to some
    technical difficulties and the delays associated with such a grand
    revamp, I wasn't able to get all of this site re-done at once.  Soon,
    be on the lookout for a complete overhaul of the site.
    </p>
    <p>
    But, you came to this site for Wasteland content, so if I may, please
    continue on to the old site, still located at <a
    href="http://bsc.edu/~bassaf/hqgrid">http://bsc.edu/~bassaf/hqgrid</a>.
    (The old site still has all of the content!)
    However, please check back here at <a
    href="https://wastelandrangerhq.github.io/hq-grid">https://wastelandrangerhq.github.io/hq-grid</a>
    often to see more of the new site's design, content and graphics.
    </p>
    <p>
    <a id="tactrequest" />
    [<font color="red">November 15, AD 2000</font>] <strike>First, a question.
    Can anyone who has played Fallout: Tactics give me a good review of the
    game?  I'd like to put some information about the game on the HQ-Grid,
    both in the timeline below and the <a href="fallout.html">Fallout</a>
    page.  Thanks in advance for the help!</strike>
    Ok, today I added a comment about
    running Fountain of Dreams inside of Windows 2000 to the recently opened
    <a href="underground_fod.html">Fountain of Dreams Room</a> at the
    Wasteland Underground.  Also added some Wasteland commentary to the
    <a href="underground.html">Wasteland Room</a>, and the first book in a
    series of post-nuke books (the Deathlands series by James Axler) at the
    <a href="../gnarly_postnuke.html">Gnarly Sellers' Post-Nuclear War Books</a>
    page.</p>
    <p>
    For almost three years now I have been in contact with a programming team
    in Hungary.  These guys, inspired by Wasteland, have been making a
    role-playing game for the Commodore 64 platform called Newcomer.  I've
    tested some of their beta versions over the years and they've
    acknowledged my help on their website and even have a link to the HQ-Grid
    (see the "Cyberlinks" and "Creation" pages).  Why should you care?  Well, I
    keep promising them that I'll give them some publicity as one of the
    "games inspired by Wasteland" but since I've never put up a page on that
    subject, my promise has been empty until now.  Check out the home page
    for <a href="http://c64.rulez.org/newcomer">Newcomer</a> and see what
    this fuss is all about!</p>
    <p>
    [<font color="red">September 27, AD 2000</font>] Thanks to my brother,
    Ranger Will, for pointing out that
    <a href="npclist.html">The Complete Wasteland NPC List</a> was missing the
    graphics accompanying some of the characters.  I have uploaded them (Jackie,
    Christina, Ace / Mayor Pedros / Covenant, Redhawk, VAX) to the site.
    Added one commentary to the <a
        href="underground.html">Wasteland Underground</a>
    (see Ugly John's stronghold).  Added one Wasteland / Fallout similarity to
    the <a href="fallout.html">Fallout</a> page.</p>
    <p>
    [<font color="red">September 11, AD 2000</font>]
      Added new commentary to the <a href="underground.html">Wasteland Underground</a>
    and also added a new Underground room: <a href="underground_fod.html">The
    Fountain of Dreams Room</a>.  Posted a tribute to Fountain of Dreams found
    in <a href="fallout.html">Fallout</a>, and posted a tribute to Wasteland found
    in <a href="fallout.html">Fallout 2</a>.  Oh, by the way,
    <a href="motekim.html">Launch code: MOTEKIM!</a> is done.  Actually,
    it has been over for quite some time.  (See the page for details.)  I have
    re-linked to a once missing <a href="chronicles.html">Wasteland Chronicle</a>,
    <em>viz.</em>, <cite>The Tale of Mr. Grizzly</cite>.  Thanks to my brother,
    Ranger Will, for pointing out that it was there but not re-linked yet.</p>
    <p>
    [<font color="red">May 4, AD 2000</font>]  I have updated the post-nuclear
    war selections you can purchase from Amazon.com at
    <a href="../gnarly_postnuke.html">The Gnarly Sellers</a>.  One new commentary
    has been uploaded to the warehouse of data stored at the
    <a href="underground.html">Wasteland Underground</a>, and a Top Ten list
    has been added to the <a href="hilarity.html">Wasteland Hilarity</a> page.</p>
    <p>
    [<font color="red">March 18, 20 AD 2000</font>] Sorry for the late update,
    but I've had a bunch of these updates on the books for a month now, but never
    uploaded them.  MobyGames'
    <a href="http://www.mobygames.com/featured_article/feature=6/">February
    feature article</a> about Wasteland is great--read it today!  Corrected the
    webring code for the poorly administrated Fallout webring on the
    <a href="fallout.html">Fallout</a> page.  Updated the Copyright date for the
    Wasteland
    <a href="chronicles.html">Chronicles</a>.  Added a new listing on the
    <a href="hqgrid-recog.html">Recognition</a> page and a new listing at the
    <a href="library.html">Gateway Library</a>.</p>
    <p>
    [<font color="red">January 19 AD 2000</font>] Reworded some of the History
    section, and added advance notice of
    <a href="http://www.mobygames.com">MobyGames</a>' February feature article
    about--you guessed it--Wasteland!  Cleaned up and added some links
    to the <a href="library.html">Gateway Library</a>.  Updated Ben Morgan's
    Exhaustive Wasteland Walkthru (to version 2.3a) at the
    <a href="underground.html">Underground</a>.</p>
    <p>
    [<font color="red">January 6 AD 2000</font>] Mini-mini-update.  Wasteland
    is inducted into the <a
    href="http://www.gamespy.com/halloffame/wasteland.shtm">gamespy Hall of
    Fame</a>!  Alright!  What a way to usher in the new <a
    href="http://www.georgian.net/rally/madness.html">Fake Millenium</a>!</p>
    <p>
    [<font color="red">October 13 AD 1999</font>] Mini-update.  Added one
    <a href="fallout.html">Fallout 2 / Wasteland similarity</a>,
    and added a statistics counter (above)
    so I can see from where in the world visitors have traveled.  Also
    <a href="chronicles.html">added</a>
    chapter 4 of <u>Rise From the Ashes</u> and chapter 4 of
    <u>Once Upon an Uzi</u>.  Lastly, I put up some information on Wasteland
    Zero at the <a href="bin.html">Binaries Database</a>.  It is a grassroots
    project to create a computer game prequel to our favorite game!
    <strong>Also</strong>, I can't believe only two folks have attempted the
    <a href="motekim.html">August Launch Code: MOTEKIM</a>!  Come on, toughen
    up rangers!</p>
    <p>
    [<font color="red">September 29 AD 1999</font>] This month's updates:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>New feature!</strong>
        <a href="hilarity.html">Wasteland Hilarity</a> is home to humorous
        articles, lists, submissions from you, the Wasteland Ranger!</li>
      <li>Removed some defunct hypertext portals from the
        <a href="library.html">Gateway Library</a>.</li>
      <li>Added several new commentaries to the
        <a href="underground.html">Wasteland Underground</a>.</li>
      <li>Added a new set of characters you can download at the
        <a href="bin.html">Binaries Database</a>.</li>
      <li>Uploaded the first chapter in a new Wasteland fiction to the
        <a href="chronicles.html">Wasteland Chronicles</a>, by Timo Takalo,
        and the first three chapters of a new Fallout fiction by Terminal Blue.</li>
      <li>Noted a new parallel between Wasteland and
        <a href="fallout.html">Fallout</a> 2.</li>
      <li>Posted a hint for the tough August
        <a href="motekim.html">Launch code: MOTEKIM</a>, along with some
        promotions for the two who've already solved it.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
    [<font color="red">August 8 AD 1999</font>] I hope you understand the dearth
    of updates recently.  If not,
    <a href="http://bsc.edu/~bassaf/timothy/timothy.html">here is why!</a>
    However, stolen minutes scattered over the past several months I have spent
    putting more content here, and it's time to share it!
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>I'm proud to release to the general viewing public the long-awaited
        Wasteland / Fountain of Dreams Tale, <a href="chronicles.html#dt">Dream
        Tales</a>, which you can now read on the HQ-Grid!  While you're there, read
        a couple of new story segments in the ongoing pennings of some
        <a href="chronicles.html#mtfwl">More Tales From the Wasteland</a>.  And
        finally, check out the first two chapters of a Fallout fan fiction in progress.</li>
      <li>I've listed some more post-apocalyptic books at the
        <a href="../gnarlybooks_books_postnuke.html">Gnarly Booksellers</a> after
        conversing with prolific author David Robbins.</li>
      <li>Solve the newest
        <a href="motekim.html">Launch Code: MOTEKIM!</a></li>
      <li>I tweaked the code for the front page.  It will load faster now that I
        have specified height and width tags in all the images.</li>
      <li>Check out the newly conglomerated <a href="endstatus/index.html">End
        Status</a> page, with two new Wasteland (actually, they're a bit old--December
        1997 and September 1998) and the HQ-Grid's first Fallout end status.</li>
      <li>Read some new commentary posted
        to the <a href="underground.html">Underground</a>!</li>
      <li>Enjoy two new Wasteland/Fallout
        tributes on the <a href="fallout.html">Fallout</a> page.</li>
      <li>The <a href="commcenter.html">Communications Center</a> has some new
        additions!</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
    [<font color="red">AD.1999.May.29</font>] I was kind of busy this month
    becoming a dad twice-over (baby boy, 8 lbs. 12 oz.!), but before that
    I did manage to work on the June update for a bit, and I've added a bit
    more to it tonight.  So, go on and read some new Wasteland fiction at the
    <a href="chronicles.html">Wasteland Chronicles</a> page!  And, although
    I've scored the May <a href="motekim.html">Launch Code: MOTEKIM!</a> entries,
    I haven't had the time to finish the June puzzle.  Maybe by mid-month, so
    stay tuned!</p>
    <p>
    [<font color="red">AD.1999.May.13</font>] Check out the last of the two
    lost <a href="maps.html">Wasteland Maps</a>!  Get ready for more
    <a href="motekim.html">Launch Code: MOTEKIM!</a>  Read the latest version
    of the Wasteland Chronicle, <a href="chronicles.html">Penelope</a>!</p>
    <p>
    [<font color="red">May 6 AD 1999</font>]
    Awesome!  Thanks to Nils Jeppe for sending me the last of the missing
    maps--Highpool and Quartz.</p>
    <p>
    [<font color="red">AD.1999.April.13.0845.Zulu</font>] One big
    addition today: check out the
    selection of post-nuclear war books I've collected at the
    <a href="../gnarlybooks_books_postnuke.html">Gnarly Booksellers</a>'
    Post-Apocalyptic Selections.  AND, three commentary additions today
    at the <a href="underground.html">Wasteland Underground</a>.  (I
    didn't take off the spinning new graphics from the April.02 update
    in case you haven't noticed them yet....)</p>
    <p>
    [<font color="red">AD.1999.April.02.0758.Zulu</font>] Here's that April update
    you've been waiting for!  Visit the overhauled
    <a href="chronicles.html">Wasteland Chronicles</a> pages and read the
    latest story by Jess Gulbranson!  Methods for correspondence with Rangers
    around the world are now centralized at the <a
    href="commcenter.html">Communications Center</a>.  I posted three (3) new
    commentaries on the <a href="underground.html">Underground</a>.
    And, <strong>FINALLY</strong>, what
    you've all been waiting for, and what will keep you coming back to the
    HQ-Grid every month....  Yes!  It's <a href="motekim.html">Launch Code:
    MOTEKIM!</a>
    (Oh, and P.S. In case you missed it, here's a <a
    href="ca_interpl_2.html">fake Press Release</a> I sent 
    out to Snake Squeezins for April Fool's Day.  Heh heh.)</p>
    <p>
    [<font color="red">March.17.1999</font>] Ok crum bums.  I edited Fat Boy's
    Wasteland End Status, both on the <a href="endstatus/index.html">End Status
    List page</a> and his own page.  (Check out his notes at the end.)  But the
    big news is: I'm taking your comments to heart.  I hope to have a new
    monthly feature implemented here at the HQ-Grid starting in April 1999.  It'll
    make you come back more than you do now, you'll love it so much.  Consider
    this a teaser.  Not like <a href="graphics/kutie.gif">this teaser</a>, of
    course, but even better!  (Heh heh.)  Annnddd, due to popular demand, I've
    denoted with a spinning new graphic those places in the Underground which
    are updated.  Speaking of which the <a href="underground.html">Underground</a>
    has been updated.  Find the spinning new graphics in the left 'contents' frame.
    (Note: some commentary is older than today, but I'm just now getting to posting
    it.  "Time, oh give me time....")</p>
    <p>
    [<font color="red">March.2.1999</font>] Added a couple of stories to the
    <a href="chronicles.html">Chronicles</a>, including a new one and a revamp
    of an old one (Boos' FoD story).  Added a
    <a href="endstatus/index.html#fod">Fountain of Dreams End Status</a>.
    A few updates to the <a href="underground.html">Underground</a>.  Also,
    there are about 140 subscribers to
    <a href="www.egroups.com/list/wasteland/">Snake Squeezins</a>, a new
    eGroup has formed for writing new WL stories at
    <a href="www.egroups.com/list/wasteland-tales/">Tales From the Wasteland</a>,
    and coding of <a href="http://209.221.152.13/waste/">Desolation!</a>
    continues.</p>
    <p>
    [<font color="red">February.5.1999</font>] The question is, what DIDN'T I
    update tonight?  As part of replying to over 20 old e-mails I recently
    uncovered from the hidden depths of my hard drive and the Internet, I've
    updated quite a bit here: Feel the thrill of new commentary in the at the
    <a href="underground.html">Underground</a>!  <strong>Two</strong> new stories
    to read in the <a href="chronicles.html">Wasteland Chronicles</a>!  The
    <a href="fallout.html">Fallout</a> page has been updated!  A super-character
    for Fallout has been uploaded for you to play-test at the
    <a href="bin.html">Binaries Database</a>!  Revel in the victories of some new
    <a href="endstatus/index.html">Wasteland End Statuses</a>!  Fixed locations
    for the walk-through and hex-edit instructions for
    <a href="fountain.html">Fountain of Dreams</a>!  Check out the 'Acquisition'
    section below for updated ways to get Wasteland!  (whew!)  Alright, that
    should keep you guys busy for a while....</p>
    <p>
    [<font color="red">January.31.1999</font>] I'm slowly going through the
    ~60 messages that I never received until this past week, and will be
    updating the various HQ-Grid pages as a result.  For now, check out the
    <a href="underground.html">Underground</a> for a few additions, as well
    as a change of "blurb" on the <a href="fallout.html">Fallout</a> page.  Also,
    <a href="http://www.egroups.com/list/wasteland/">Snake Squeezins</a> is
    up to ~140 subscribers.  Come join the discussion!</p>
    <p>
    [<font color="red">January.27.1999</font>] Retraction!  Using
    <a href="mailto:bassaf@bsc.edu">bassaf @ bsc.edu</a> will be just fine.
    Although I can no longer auto-forward from there to my other accounts,
    I can now access my mail directly without having to forward.  So carry
    on with the volumes of mail!</p>
    <p>
    [<font color="red">January.8.1999</font>] Added links to a
    <a href="fountain.html">Fountain of Dreams</a> walk-through and a character
    hex-editor.  Enjoy!</p>
    <p>
    [<font color="red">January.5.1999</font>] Updated one thing for the new year.
    Can you guess what it is?  [It was the year, 1999.  -RB]</p>
    <p>
    [<font color="red">December.16.1998</font>] Found an HTML error in<u>Tales From the Wasteland</u>
    and dutifully corrected it.  (It was in the second paragraph of Tale Four.)  Also, the
    <a href="http://www.egroups.com/list/wasteland/">Snake Squeezins</a> eGroup is up to 102
    subscribers, with a total of 14,113 messages read just at eGroups.com.  Double also, there is
    a Wasteland MUD in development.  It is called <a href="http://209.221.152.13/waste/">Desolation!</a>,
    and if you would like to help code, stop on by!  The location of the actual MUD is at
    telnet:wl.squid.org 7878.</p>
    <p>
    [<font color="red">October.19.1998</font>] Visit the overhauled
    <a href="fountain.html">Fountain of Dreams</a> pages, complete with some graphics from the game,
    and a corrected uppercase typo.  (For shame, me spelling Florida as F<strong>L</strong>orida.)</p>
    <p>
    [<font color="red">October.14.1998</font>] I've formally set up the
    <a href="bin.html">Binaries Database</a> to accomodate binaries for download.  With
    the recent acquisition of the Wasteland Character Editor,
    I thought I'd set up a page that listed such binaries.  Check it out!  Also, I've
    added a blurb on the main page about Fallout 2, coming soon to a computer game store
    near you.  The homage to Wasteland continues!  (Ok, at this point, they're probably
    riding on the coattails of Fallout [1], not trying to lop on more tribute to Wasteland,
    but that depends on your point of view.)</p>
    <p>
    On a different note, <a href="http://www.egroups.com/list/wasteland/">Snake Squeezins</a>
    has been getting a lot of traffic.  As of today, we're at 36 subscribers including Wasteland
    Creators Mike Stackpole, Ken St. Andre and Alan Pavlish.  Come join the discussion!</p>
    <p>
    [<font color="red">October.2.1998</font>] Thanks to Ranger Roark for recovering one
    of our <a href="maps.html">Wasteland Maps</a>, the map to the Silver Mines near Quartz!</p>
    <p>
    [<font color="red">September.26+28.1998</font>] Inspired by my own guilt at the lack of
    updates, I processed about 20 Wasteland mails backed up in my mailbox this weekend and
    updated a few pages: <a href="fallout.html">Fallout</a>, <a href="underground.html">The
    Wasteland Underground</a>, a minor tweaking to a <a href="endstatus/index.html">Wasteland
    End Status</a>, and the Acquisition section.
    I've also noticed that as of today, there are 16 people subscribed to
    <a href="http://www.egroups.com/list/wasteland/">Snake Squeezins</a>, and there have been
    19 unique users who've read a combined total of 179 messages on our list.  Alright!</p>
    <p>
    [<font color="red">September.22.1998</font>] Admittedly, I'm slow with updates recently.
    But not for lack of information and material sent in by loyal Rangers!  Patience, my friends!
    In the meantime, here's a positive response to one recent e-mail:
    <a href="http://www.egroups.com/list/wasteland/">Snake Squeezins</a>, an eGroup mailing list.
    Basically, you can access the mail to this list from the web or from your e-mail account, or
    both!  To subscribe, check out the colored form box above.  Happy Squeezin!</p>
    <p>
    [<font color="red">July.7.1998</font>]
    Wow!  Thanks to Ranger Fredrik for sending me two of the missing maps--the
    Agricultural Center and the Rail Nomad Camp.  He'd downloaded them a while
    back when I still had the site at www.wasteland.org.  My eternal thanks,
    Fredrik!  If anyone can find the rest, do let me know!</p>
    <p>
    [<font color="red">June.9.1998</font>] Updated the Acquisition section below to reflect some
    recent changes in pricing and availability of Wasteland.</p>
    <p>
    [<font color="red">May.15+21.1998</font>]
    Added some new commentary to the <a href="underground.html">Wasteland Underground</a>,
    a new <a href="endstatus/index.html">Wasteland End Status</a>, and a new
    <a href="chronicles.html">Wasteland Chronicle</a>!  Also, just for fun, added some links to the
    computer game companies featured in the top 20 of the Computer Gaming World Magazine's 150
    Best Games of All Time found on the <a href="cgwNov96-review.html">Review of Wasteland</a> page.
    Check 'em out!</p>
    <p>
    [<font color="red">April.30.1998</font>]
    I found Alexander's Complete Wasteland map on another Wasteland site out there.  So someone
    must have snagged it before it was deleted from the HQ-Grid.  Yee-ha!  The map is back up
    in all it's glory with Alexander's notations, on the <a href="maps.html">Wasteland Map Collection</a>.
    Again, if anyone has the other maps that Alexander created, please do inform me so I can re-post
    them at the HQ-Grid.</p>
    <p>
    [<font color="red">April.6.1998</font>]
    I cleaned out the <a href="library.html">Gateway Library</a> by adding some new links
    and pounding some bad links into ground round.</p>
    <p>
    [<font color="red">March.27.1998</font>]
    The HQ-Grid is now a member of Tim Gray's
    <a href="http://www.sccs.swarthmore.edu/~gray/wastering.html">Wasteland Web
    Ring</a>.  Join up today and connect <em>your</em> Wasteland site!</p>
    <p>
    [<font color="red">March.23.1998</font>]
    Thanks to Tim Gray for locating the 
    <a href="wlreset.html">Unofficial Wasteland Reset Program</a> for me.  It
    is now available for download from the Binaries Database at the HQ-Grid.</p>
    <p>
    [<font color="red">March.20.1998</font>]
    Several perceptive Rangers out there have informed me that Jeremy Reaban's
    <a href="wlreset.html">Unofficial Wasteland Reset Program</a> is no longer
    accessible at his site.  Furthermore, his site is no longer accessible
    either!  <strike>If anyone has downloaded this program,
    please send it to me!</strike>  I have searched my archives and
    file systems but cannot seem to find where I stashed it.  This seems
    to be quite a popular program, based on the fact that I've had five
    inquiries in the last week as to where it is!</p>
    <p>
    [<font color="red">March.4.1998</font>]
    I added some references to Wasteland found within the Fallout game at the
    <a href="fallout.html">Fallout</a> page.  (And I even fixed a missing right
    parenthesis and a typo on the
    <a href="fountain.html">Fountain of Dreams</a> page.  Yes, I do pay
    attention to the slightest details, all for your viewing pleasure!)</p>
    <p>
    [<font color="red">January.27-28.1998</font>]
    I finally scanned in the game box for <a href="fountain.html">Fountain
    of Dreams</a>.  Enjoy!  Also, see History and/or Acquisition for
    the latest re-release of Wasteland!</p>
    <p>
    [<font color="red">January.15.1998</font>]
    Some new commentary on various topics has been added at the
    <a href="underground.html">Wasteland Underground</a>.</p>
    <p>
    [<font color="red">December.29.1997</font>]
    The Acquisition section below has been
    updated, for those of you looking to find a copy of Wasteland for your very
    own.</p>
    <p>
    [<font color="red">December.24.1997</font>]
    More Wasteland end stats have been posted to the
    <a href="endstatus/index.html">Wasteland Characters End Status page</a>.</p>
    <p>
    [<font color="red">December.9.1997</font>]
    Some new commentary has been added and links and pictures have been fixed
    at the <a href="underground.html">Wasteland Underground</a>!  The
    <a href="fallout.html">Fallout</a> page lists some tributes
    to Wasteland found in the new Fallout game!</p>
    <p>
    [<font color="red">October.15.1997</font>]
    The latest story in the <a href="chronicles.html">Wasteland Chronicles</a>,
    this one by Maestro the Rookie, can now be read on this site!</p>
    <p>
    <img src="graphics/wlbutton.gif" align="right" alt="The Wasteland Ranger HQ-Grid" />
    [<font color="red">September.13.1997</font>] Download the Wasteland Ranger
    HQ-Grid button and proudly display it on your home page as a link
    to the Wasteland Ranger HQ-Grid!  See the <a href="wlnow.html">Wasteland
    Button</a> page for details.</p>
    <p>
    [<font color="red">September.3.1997</font>]
    The next chapter in the life of Wasteland has been written, see the
    History section on the main page!</p>
    <p>
    [<font color="red">August.29.1997</font>] Newly re-loaded onto the pages, the
    first Wasteland Chronicle penned by a non-Assafian Maestro.  Read Jordan
    Boos' <u>Fountain of Dreams</u> story at <a href="chronicles.html">The Wasteland
    Chronicles</a> page!</p>
    <p>
    [<font color="red">August.19.1997</font>] The Wasteland Ranger HQ-Grid has
    returned to a more stable location (http://www.csc.lsu.edu/~bassaf/hqgrid),
    after a disasterous attempt at relocation to http://www.wasteland.org/hqgrid.
    Unfortunately, most of my graphics are stuck on the old, locked-out site.  
    My original source for the maps also
    has lost the maps due to a hard drive crash.  If any one has the maps downloaded
    will you please send them to me, and I will re-post them on the site.  Thanks!</p>
    <p>
    [<font color="red">May.25.1997</font>] The Wasteland Ranger HQ-Grid has
    been moved to a new location, namely http://www.wasteland.org/hqgrid.  I was
    offered an account back in January 1997, and finally decided to move the
    pages there.  Hopefully this will be a great new site for the HQ-Grid!</p>
    <p>
    [<font color="red">October.25.1995</font>] The Wasteland Ranger HQ-Grid was
    born this day, to be found at the URL of http://bit.csc.lsu.edu/~bassaf/hqgrid.
    (And there was much rejoicing....)</p>
