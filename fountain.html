    <p>
    In AD 1990 <A HREF="http://www.ea.com/" target="_top">Electronic
    Arts</a> released
    Fountain of Dreams for the IBM-compatible PC.  Set in post-war Florida,
    after the "enemy" neutron-bombed the mainland of Florida to
    preserve its technology (<em>viz.</em>, Cape Canavral) but wipe out its
    inhabitants.  However, Florida itself was jerked off the continental United
    States by nuclear vollies in Georgia!  The life that crept out of the
    armaggedon has rebuilt a Florida much mutated.</p>

    In this post-nuclear war game, you and your chums set out to find the
    Fountain of Dreams and its purifying water because, sorry to say: "Plain
    as the third nose on your face, you're mutating."

    Although displaying similar game-play, the Fountain of Dreams game
    engine is not the same as the Wasteland game engine.  There are
    apparently some bad vibes between the Wasteland programmers and Dave
    Albert and Banjo Bob (a.k.a.  Ojnab the Occultist from the game)
    Hardy, as the EA programmers didn't capture the essence of the game,
    Wasteland, by creating a game with only about 20% of the depth and
    breadth of the Wasteland game.

    I last trekked it through back in 1997 with Jakkin Redd, Carey Smacki,
    Junior [Redd], Enrique Ochoa, and Imelda DeSoto.  Poor ol' Ignatz Crebs
    met his demise at the jowls of a hungry Dobermutant, and B.L. Astor just
    wasn't pullin' her weight in .556 ammo so I dumped her.  The Clown
    Compound was foremost on their minds when I had to put the game on a
    hiatus, and I never got back to it.

    Thanks to some sleuthing by a
    <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/wasteland/">Snake Squeezins</a>
    poster, I've tracked down a Fountain of Dreams walk-through.
    I originally snagged this file from
    <a href="http://www.softwarezone.com">SoftwareZone Games</a>.  This
    walk-through seems pretty complete, but don't take it from me--I didn't
    write it!

       target="new">Peter Karsanow</a> has put together a "FAQ, Guide and
    Walkthrough" that has undergone several revisions.  He and I have
    communicated off and on over about Fountaion of Dreams lore.

    <a href="http://www.softwarezone.com">SoftwareZone Games</a> also
    had instructions on how to do a a hex editing of save game / characters.
    This HEX cheat was originally written in July of 1990.  I
    have never attempted to use this procedure to edit my files.  If you have,

    In addition, here is a smattering of some images I gleaned from various

    screen-capture happy.  Enjoy!  (Select the picture to see the "full-size"

    <div class="section" id="sect_acq">Get Fountain of Dreams:</div>
    <p>
    "Ok, I've read enough!  How can I get Fountain of Dreams?" you may be
    saying.  (While this statement is very unlikely, it is plausible for
    die-hard fans of the genre!)  First of all, before you ask, please note
    that I won't be putting Fountaion of Dreams up for download at the
    HQ-Grid due to copyright laws; nor am I in the practice of pirating my
    original copy over e-mail.  Here are some places to start looking:
    </p>

    <ol>
      <li>Search <a href="http://search.ebay.com/fountain-of-dreams-game"
      >eBay</a> or <a
      href="http://search.auctions.yahoo.com/search/auc?p=fountain+of+dreams&amp;alocale=0us&amp;acc=us"
      >Yahoo! Auctions</a>,
      or other auction sites for Wasteland.  Unfortunately, this may be your
      best bet in the 21<sup>st</sup> century!</li>

      <li> You might find a used copy by placing a want ad on the USENET
      newsgroup <a href="news:comp.sys.ibm.games.marketplace" target="_top"
         >comp.sys.ibm.games.marketplace</a>
        or one of the other newsgroups with a "swap 'n' shop" mentality.</li>

      <li> The Electronic Arts Customer Warranty Department used to sell
      old warranty copies, but I'm not sure this is a viable option anymore.
      I used to have their phone number posted here but it is apparently
      no longer in service.  (Thanks to Ranger Michelle for reporting this
      in from the field back in January 2001.)  If you want to write them to
      inquire, the last address I have on file for them is this:
      <br />
      <pre>Electronic Arts
Customer Warranty
PO BOX 7578
SAN MATEO, CA 94403</pre>
      You might visit <a href="http://www.ea.com">EA's home page</a> and
      see if you can get anything else from them.  (But I doubt you will!)
      </li>

    <p>
    If you're looking to discuss Fountain of Dreams with other FoD enthusiasts,
    if there are any, that is (heh heh) you might check out the Yahoo! Group
    <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/fod/">fod</a>, which I was a
    faithful subscriber, reader and poster to for many years until I finally
    gave up on it due to lack of activity.  Somewhere hidden on this page is
    the actual date I unsubscribed, think of it as a little bit of pointless
    fun you weren't expecting?  Apart from that, on occasion the Yahoo! Group
    <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/wastealdn">Snake Squeezins</a>
    discusses it.
