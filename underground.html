    Welcome to the information storehouse dedicated to providing all
    one will ever need to know about <em>playing</em>
    the computer role-playing game, <strong>Wasteland</strong>.
    <p />
    If during the course of playing this game, one cannot figure out how
    to proceed, then this is the place to visit.  The information on the
    Underground has been compiled by Ranger Ben for the purpose of helping
    a player play the game successfully, but more importantly get to and
    through every plot and plot hole known to exist in the
    game.

    Not present here is commentary about the <strong>Fallout</strong>
    series of games, <em>viz.</em>, <strong>Fallout</strong>, <strong>Fallout
       2</strong>, and <strong>Fallout Tactics: Brotherhood of
       Steel</strong>.  There are abundant resources elsewhere on the Grid
    where vault dwellers might go for tips on how to win those games.  If the
    reader is unfamiliar with this series of games, then not only does this
    mean they somehow missed the 1990s but they should also <a

Speaking to the Junk Master does not reveal the location of Base
Cochise.  Only completing the Sewers under Vegas will.

<p />
<em>Commentary by L. Leung <!--Larry--> (March 20, 2003)</em>
<br />
Are you aware of the trick that allows a Wasteland player to "resurrect" Base 
Cochise after it's been destroyed? After your party blows up the place, if
you enter the helicopter in the  Guardian Citadel and fly it to Base Cochise,
you will arrive at the base. The self-destruct timer will still countdown,
but the base will never blow up. You'll still have encounters, and 
can even pick up Vax if you haven't already done so.

<br />
If you speak to the Cochise computer he says this:
<p />
Question: Mission<br />
My mission?  To repopulate the earth with pure stock once my minions 
have destroyed all other life.  I will win.
<p />
Question: Finster<br />
Finster was a fool.  He thought he could rebel, but he was easy to 
break.  If not for me, he would have killed you.

The ultimate tool for [raising your fighting skills] is Brother Goliath.
To raise Fisticuffs
or Brawling you need AC 10 at least. Always use the least dangerous
weapon you can, (i.e., a Book for Brawling, etc.) He can raise your guys
up to level 7 in most fighting skills. He can't move, so stand back and
plink at him. Be careful not to kill him he is too good a resource.

<strong>Platform:</strong> all (with macros)
<p />
<em>Commentary by B. French <!-- Brian --> (January 19, 1998),
update by Kid Kibbitz (June 12, 1998)</em><br />
I know a way to get your characters a lot of experience quickly in
Wasteland.  I don't know if this is common knowledge or not, but here
goes.
<p />
What you need to do is make sure all your PC's have the climb ability.  
Then, hire an NPC that does NOT have the climb ability.
<p />
Take your party to the casino in Vegas that's NOT Fat Freddy's.
There should be a trap door set in the floor behind a counter.  Go down
it, and you'll be inside a basement that's pretty trashed.  Along the
north wall, there is some rubble.  Move your party over the rubble until
they hit the wall, then keep moving.  Put something over the arrow key
and go get a Coke or something.  What should happen is that your party
continually climbs the rubble, gaining XP as they go.  The NPC is the
one holding them back, so they never actually make it over the rubble.
I got all my characters to Supreme Jerk this way.  Needless to say, the
rest of the game was pretty easy :)
<p />
Note: This trick also works at the Railroad Clans map, but it MUCH
slower.  Just climb the sandhills over and over and over.....
<p />
<em>Commentary by V. Caine <!-- Venato --> (September 22, 1998)</em><br />
The climb skill and cheat is beneath through the east door next to the bar in
Spade's Casino.  Go through the first north door and use a rope on the
hole, then climb skill to get down.  As a sidenote one of the Card Sharks in
the NW of the casino has a nice laser pistol you can get for minimal
effort.
<p />
<em>Commentary by C. Vickers <!-- Codie --> (October 5, 1998)</em><br />
Also, in Needles there are several sand hills.
If your characters keep trying to climb them their climb and acrobat skills
BOTH go up until they get to 3.
Also, on top of Base Cochise, you can climb around on the outside walls to get
climb of 8 or 9!

<em>Commentary by Ranger Ben</em><br />
Contrary to what <a href="#merlintips">Jon Malan's tips</a> say about
"cryptography" [sic.], I found another use for the Cryptology skill.  In the end
game, final board with the keys in the corners of the room, the south
wall has a spot on it.  One of my characters, Jodri Deahgge, noticed this
spot with his Cryptology skill, and increased his skill level from 1 to 2.
He also deciphered the code on the wall.

<a href="fileswapping">file swapping</a>.
<p />
<em>Commentary by T. Maki <!-- Todd --> (April 22, 1996)</em><br />
For anyone else who plays on a Commodore 64 here is a cheat which 
may work on the Apple platform as well.  Try this anywhere in the game you 
want extra equipment, say the <a href="#sleeperbase">Sleeper Base</a>
weapons area.
<p />
(1) Before start to play Wasteland make an extra set of disks and keep 
them unused.<br />
(2) Before you go into a new location (Example from above... going from 
level 1 to level 2 at Sleeper base) swap your used disk for the unused 
disk of the same number. Then select "y" to enter the new location and 
get whatever you need. *** Do Not Leave This New Area &amp; Do Not Save In 
This Area Yet ***<br />
(3) ONLY RETURN TO THE AREA YOU ORIGINALY CAME FROM. Before you leave the 
area and return to the area you came from (Level 1 from above.. Enter a 
New Location "y/n") replace the unused disk currently in your drive with 
your original used disk.  (This way nothing has been altered on the
"Unused Disk")  You can go into the same area as many times as you want 
and get equipment over and over again....  (Very helpful when you find good 
weapons or armour.)<br />
<p />
<em>Commentary by E. Tan <!-- Eugene --> (June 24, 1996)</em><br />
The swap disk cheat works on the Apple //. I should know. . . .
I finished the game on my old //e!
<p />
<em>Commentary by Clem the Hick (October 24, 1996)</em><br />
With disk swapping cheat on the Commodore 64, you can win the game repeatedly,
though the second time through and on, you won't get the huge bonus from
Ranger Center at the end.
<p />
<em>Commentary W. J. Altman <!-- William --> (November 13, 1996)</em>:
<br />
To duplicate your items (and equip your group of seven with power armour
and proton axes) you can use this simple trick if you are running the
game off an Apple //e.
<p />
Note you will need excessive cash for this.  Enter a store.  Sell the stuff
you want to copy.  Leave.  Reenter the store.  Replace the current game disk
with a blank one.  Buy your stuff and leave.  When leaving it will give some
error and ask ou to check the disk.  Replace the game disk.  When you go back
into the store it will be as though you never bought anything.  This is real
handy for the people who happen to run out of ammo while running through the
sewers and drain the stores dry (like myself the first time).
<p />
<em>Commentary by Jimmy (December 29, 1999)</em><br />
I played wasteland for the first time on a C-64. With this program you only
had the floppy disks. I found that if you had two sets of the disks, and one
extra set of disk one, you could copy your players from one disk to another.
The same process can be done by copying the total program onto three disks.
The first disk should have a copy of your characters, simply enter the Ranger
Center, then when you leave place the new unplayed copy into the drive.
Now your players should be able to start the game over again. I have used this
process to obtain several proton axes, and also to gain large amounts of
experience points.

<em>Commentary by Cliff (October 18, 1997)</em><br />
When I played Wasteland on my C64 (back in 88-89), I used a cheating method
which could duplicate any armor an unlimited number of times.  I forgot
how to do it though and was wondering if anyone else had discovered the cheat.
<p />
<em>Commentary by J. Dunlap <!-- James --> (September 26, 1998)</em><br />
The way to duplicate items on the C64 is this:
<p />
<ol>
  <li>Make a backup of the data disk that contains the item(s) that you
  want.</li>
  <li>(optional) Go in and kill everything in the place, but DO NOT TAKE
  ANYTHING!!</li>
  <li>Exit with the backup disk in the drive.</li>
  <li>Reenter and grab all the stuff.</li>
  <li>Exit with your other data disk in the drive.  (Not the backup).</li>
  <li>Anytime you enter, use the backup and the items will still be there.
  When you exit, use your data disk.</li>
</ol>

<em>Commentary by J. Webb <!-- Jody --></em><br />
In my experience, an Energy Weapon skill level above 8 seems detrimental.
My characters seemed to be less accurate, and to inflict less damage when
using an Energy Weapon skill of above 10 or so.

<p />

<em>Commentary by Black Raven (January 16, 1997)</em><br />
With the <a href="#negskillcheat">neg-skill cheat</a>, your Energy Weapon
skill does not go bad after the
10th level.  In fact, your accuracy rate improves dramatically.  This is also
true with Assault Rifle, <a href="#atweapons">AT Weapon</a>, etc.

Another trick to get 4 or more Rad Suits in about 5 minutes is to get
Christina and take hers and her geiger counter. then buy 4 tnt and go to the
south-west part of needles and go into the waste pit. Go down and straight
across from the steps. The first door should crumble. The next one needs
to be blown up. Go down the stairs and blow open the next 2
doors, and kill the pit dweller. Go to the south-western door and blow it
open. You'll find about 1 or 2 NATO's and 2 or more rad suits... Next get 1
TNT and go to Las Vegas. Go find the mushroom cult and go in. Use the
passwords and go up. Blow open the eastern door right before entering the
reactor room. There should be 2 rad suits. There ya go.

Faran Brygo's computer apparently caters to your operating system, or at

behold, his computer is an Apple //e.  In the Commodore port, it's also an

But here's a possible explanation offered at Squeezins:

<blockquote>Well, it kinda makes sense seeing as how the C=64 version was
   based on the Apple // version (the original) and the PC version was built
   from the ground up. -- Ranger L. Mazzei</blockquote>

On the IBM-PC version, his computer is IBM AT.

<strong>Platform:</strong> IBM-PC

<em>Commentary by Private 1st Class K. Ballou <!-- Kennon -->
   (May 14, 1998)</em><br />
You can use a variation of the <a href="#diskswapping">disk swapping cheat</a>
technique from the C64 or Apple on
the IBM by making a backup copy of the two files GAME1 and GAME2.
GAME1 contains the maps for the outside map, and the first
few areas, such as Highpool, Ag Center, etc. GAME2 contains
the other maps. What I did many many times was to do a map
like Vegas, get as much as possible from it, then leave there
and go to the desert map. I'd save the game and then quit. In 
DOS, I'd copy my GAME2 backup onto the GAME2 file used by 
the game. All of the GAME2 maps would then be reset, but not
the characters or the GAME1 maps. The party info is stored
in whichever map they are in; <em>i.e.</em> if you are in a GAME2 
location and save over GAME2 your party will be replaced
by Thrasher, Angela Deth, etc.

<p />

<em>Commentary by C. De Souza (May 15, 2001)</em><br />
There is a cheat (sort of) to get unlimited power cells for the Sonic
Cannon and Ion Beamer (I can't get the names correct). Its somewhere in the
Citadel (where brother Goliath and other brothers gather), in one of the rooms.
What I did last time when my save games are in diskettes, is:
<ol>
   <li>Make a copy of the map file to another diskette.</li>
   <li>Get all power cells,</li>
   <li>Save the game</li>
   <li>Re-copy the map file to overwrite the existing.</li>
   <li>Reload the save game and woila !!  The cells shows up again.</li>
</ol>
I use this very often because I hate to use burst. I rather clean up my gun
in one shot to ionise my enemies. (Especially Brother Goliath. Arrrgh, I really
hate him. He killed of my doctor in one shot and I have to re-start the
mission. The rest of my team is MORTALLY WOUNDED...).

<p />

<a id="fileswapping3"><em>Commentary by T. <!-- Ted --> Bowen
      (July 27, 2003)</em></a><br /> 
Actually it is unnecessary to quit the game (see May 14, 1998 commentary,
above) in order to "reset" any area of
the game you like (in the PC version).  The game automatically saves an area
(or a shop) when you exit.  You have to leave the area or shop that you want
to reset, but you don't need to leave the game itself to do it.  You need at
least two copies of the game, so keep them in separate directories or disks. 
Here's how it works:
<ol>
   <li>Do what you wish in an area, and exit it in the state you wish to re-use.</li>
   <li>Alt-tab out of the game and make a backup copy of the GAME1 and GAME2 files
   (one of them may do, but both of them will definitely work) in this state.</li>
   <li>Return to the game, re-enter the area and loot it, then exit the area
   again.  Alt-tab again, and copy over both files if you like, with the backups
   you made.</li>
   <li>Repeat steps 1-3 as necessary.</li>
</ol>
(To repeatedly re-enter an area as it was before you ever touched it, copy
GAME1 and GAME2 before you enter the area; to re-do the whole game, use the
original install-versions to restore the files.)
<p />
As a side-note, I refer to this as the <strong>alternative-realities</strong>
approach to
cheating, and it still works in many modern games as well, though it is
usually only useful for duplicating items.  For instructions on how to use a
similar technique in Diablo II or Warcraft III: The Frozen Throne (on
multi-map RPGs), anyone may contact me through Ranger Ben.

<em>Commentary by D. Sinner <!-- Drokk --> (May 4, 1998)</em><br />
Gambling is actually an extremly useful skill. It can help you level very fast
and give you an infinite supply of cash. See to it that all your chars have
decent luck and spend 1 of those valuable skill points on luck. When you have
enough money and can get into Vegas without dying, go to the nomads camp and
play at the slot machine. Play until one of your characters have a gambling
skill around 9-10, using a macro of course (remember to level once in a while,
you can't
have a higher skill than your current level), and a luck around 17-18.
Then go to Vegas and play some 3 card monty. Preferably make a macro for it.
Let the macro go on for some 15 minutes, in some way locking the macro key. Now
you should have around $50000 profit and and some 10 levels
(of course this depends on which level you was on when you started)
waiting for ya!!! I think that you get one xp for every $ you make!
Repeat with all your chars and you'll get cash for the
rest of the game and an edge in the levels. You could of course let the macro
run while you sleep or something, but that would be a bit to much cheating,
eh? ;)

Anybody ever have any interesting glitches in their original games?  
I remember the first time I ever played, as the game was loading I 
got to see Base Cochise blow up.  And when I started that first game 
it actually started me out next to the blown-up Cochise -- with the 
start-up party.

Seem to have "shared a glitch experience" with another - entering Finster's 
Mind Maze and getting "trapped" in a room without doors, that appeared to be on 
the ground floor. This appeared to be a glitch to me, but perhaps was some sort 
of "trap" in the game!

<p />
Also mentioned <strong>three</strong> other possible glitches,
<strong>but noted that these occurred after getting two "super loot"
bags</strong> in the same game, so possibly they're <strong>not</strong>
real Game Glitches! Just to repeat them, they were:

<p />
1) When exiting Fat Freddie's hideout/casino, ended up inside Base Cochise with 
no way out. No Secpass B key OR any ropes hanging from the ceiling!

<p />
2) When entering Fat Freddie's office (for the first time) the "normal message 
routine" was not there and was trapped in his office with no way out!

<p />
3) Approached the door at the Acapulco Club, but the "Do you wish to exit the 
club" message was not there. Again trapped inside a location with no way out!

<p />
Again - wasn't sure if these were glitches OR just traps for Super Loot bags 
greediness!

I saw in the archive that you can use a Match in the Highpool cave,
however what wasn't mentioned is that this changes the Rabid Dog into a

By the entrance there are 3-4 squares that give the message "it's dark
down in the cave" or something. You have to use [a match] there before passing
the first heap o' rubble. You'll know it works if you discover a frayed

<strong>Hole #2: super skills.</strong>
<p />
If you've ever gone to a library, when your skill is high enough, it shows a
255 to increase it, now i'm not sure if you have to gamble first, but when you
select it, it will add a skill point, and add a stat point (give you a point i
the ability and your reserve skill points). You can increase it up to your
level, so you need experience. One way to do this is to gamble,. Once you get
your skill to 8, use this trick (note, you must go into the library with at
least one skill point to start out with), and increase your <a
   href="#gambling">Gambling skill</a>. Now
make a macro, usually some thing like this:<p />
Y-SPACE BAR-1-1-SPACE BAR<p />
This will (in Fat Freddy's): Yes for playing, select player 1 to get the loot,
which is item one. The best thing is, you get experience points for winning,
and (oh yeah, the <a href="#armor">name ac</a> sells for 32,000 cash)
you won't lose at a gamble
skill that high. What you do is get a piece of tape, tape down the macro key,
and do something else for an hour or so. When you get back, you'll have some
levels waiting for you, as well as a surpluss of cash.

<p />
<em>Commentary by Clem the Hick</em><br />
I saw you guys had the negative skill point cheat (I never knew how it worked,
though), and thought I'd add that I had figured it out previously on my C-64,
and I noticed that some of my characters got 68-71 skill points the first time
they'd raise a skill to level eight.  It didn't always work, but seemed to work
best when the chars. were at a certain level (though I don't remember what it
was--that was six years ago!)

<a id="nightmare"><span class="darkred">
  Night Terror in Finster's Head</span></a><br />
<p />
You probably know that the Nightmare [Night Terror] in Finster's Head is one of the toughest
creatures to defeat.  However, you may not know that it gives you the most
experience if you do kill it, and of course twice that if you beat it with
melee weapons.  Here is some commentary about that....
<p />
<em>Commentary by C. Vickers <!-- Codie --> (October 5, 1998)</em><br />
If you have a proton ax when you jack into Finsters Head and lots of brawling
skill you can kill the nightmare in just under an hour. You get TONS of
experience. Also, if you have a disk editor you can fiddle with NPC character
attrbutes/skills/possessions/etc (this includes CLONE npcs!) and then have
them join the party. With brawling skill:255, str:255 and dex:255 you can
kill the nightmare with a proton axe (or a canteen or a crowbar or anything
you can get readied as a weapon) in one or two rounds.
<p />
<em>Commentary by T. Bowen (July 27, 2003)</em><br /> <!-- Ted -->
About the Night Terror, it is not only possible to kill the Night Terror, it
is possible to get your whole party into Finster's Brain, which dramatically
cuts down on the time it takes to kill the Night Terror, not to mention
complete the other tasks.  Do this:
<ol>
   <li>Duplicate Finster's Brain 6 times using the
   <a href="#fileswapping3">alternative-realities method</a>
   (backup your gamestate files before you take the brain, exit the area, restore
   the files, re-enter the area, take the brain again, repeat).</li>

   <li>Enter the Brain one person at a time; everyone must have cyborg tech and a
   Finster's Brain.  I.E. disband one character and enter the brain; view the
   other part of the party, disband one more and enter the brain; view, disband,
   enter the brain until everyone is there!</li>
</ol>
For fun combine steps 1 and 2!  (Kill Finster and save the game, backup your
files, take the brain and have 1 person enter it; before you view the others,
restore the game to its state as it was before you took the brain; view the
others and take the brain again, enter the brain with the second person;
restore the game again; repeat.)
<p />
Of course, to kill the Night Terror multiple times by file-swapping, you will
need to keep at least 1 character outside Finster's Brain.

Alternatively, you can use the bootdisk to install the

there.  This disk will have CD-ROM drivers to run your
CD-ROM and enough memory to run the game. If you
need a bootdisk I can send you a ".img" file of a
working bootdisk. With a utility like rawrite (I can
get that too), you can create a bootdisk.

In Vegas, at Spade's Casino, there is a loose board you can step over if you

wait (press Esc.) over and over.
This will increase your <a href="#silentmove">silent move</a> AND Perception.

<p />
<em>Commentary by G. Cunningham <!-- Gary --> (November 29, 2001)</em><br />
Make sure all characters have Perception and go to the glass wall on the back
way into the Hideout in Quartz.  Create a macro to move your party the full
length of the glass wall several times (the macros only support a limited
amount of commands).  Now, hit the macro button like 30 times (the command
buffer only hold so many commands) and watch your perception levels fly up
and each character gains xp for each perception roll, failed or passed.
After a little bit, Radio on in and watch the levels fly.  While I don't
recommend this to anyone who wants to really experience the game, this does
make the Citadel much easier.

Here are some miscellaneous comments about getting fast and free promotions,
sent in by dedicated and efficient Rangers in the field.

<p />
<em>Commentary by B. Spangler <!-- Ben --> (August, 1996)</em><br />
The exact location of the free promotions spot:
<p />
Starting at the NE corner of the Darwin Base, 1 pace N, 1 pace E, 2 paces
N, 2 paces E, 10 paces N, and 8 paces W. This will position your party
in the middle of a hot spot on the map. Now, just shove a pencil in 
ESC key, to make time pass quickly, and check back in about an hour 
for your free promotion. The free promotions coupled with the super
skills make an indestructable party.

<p />
<em>Commentary by Private 1st Class K. Ballou <!-- Kennon -->
   (May 14, 1998)</em><br />
The night terror in Finster's mind maze is definitely killable. I equip
my guy with a proton axe, send him into the maze, and make a macro for
one round with the beast. Then I tape down the key and come back in half
an hour. It takes forever, but with power armor the character will not be
hurt at all, and when you kill him you get 64,000 exp. Then you leave darwin,
reset the GAME2 file [see <a href="#fileswapping">file swapping cheat</a>],
and do it again! I got many many many many levels on
all of my characters by doing this endlessly.  64000 will give each char several
promotions the first time, but it gets to a point where you only get one
promotion per 64000 exp.

<p />
<em>Commentary by S. Hunter <!-- Steve --> (April 2, 1998)</em><br />
The best way to gain experience is to arm all characters with a proton ax or
similar weapon and stand in Base Cochise on the ground level between the ladder
and the door which requires a secpass b to enter.  All random encounters will
appear at distance 10.  A few hours of fighting these random encounters should
get characters from cadet to captain or more.

<p />
<em>Commentary by J. Walter <!-- Jascha --> (June 10, 1998)</em><br />
If you run up and down the glass window at Ugly's hideout, you get
unlimited promotions.  [editor's note: see also <a href="#uglyjohn">Ugly
John's Stronghold</a>

<p />
<em>Commentary by R. Clayton <!-- Richard --> (March 12, 1999)</em><br />
Yes, this does work- at least, with the IBM-PC version. I don't know
about the Apple version. This is probably the easiest, most acessible
way to gain fast levels- just set a macro to walk a square north, then a
square south. Repeat as necessary.
As to whether or not this is cheating- well, that's up to you. I
don't use it- there are more entertaining ways to gain levels. :)

<p />
<em>Commentary by Malakorr (March 8, 1999)</em><br />
In Spade's Casino... when you encounter the squeaky board upstairs. Save your
game, put the character with the Silent Move skill in the lead and create a
macro to just walk back and forth over it. You'll need to "babysit" your party
for a while... cause it takes a bit to get them up high enough that they won't
get caught by the guards in the room to the south. Be sure to have perception
for all of your characters tho... I recommend that the macro be as many
keystrokes as you have the patience for with S-Y-N at the end of it... once
the macro is created just wedge the key down and go do something for a while.
Once you  think the macro has run long enough just radio in for a LOT of
promotions. I managed to get my characters up from Private 1st Class to
Supreme Jerk.. took a loooooong time but I did it. I reccomend doing it while
you sleep. It's also a good idea to enter Vegas from the top north corner,
pick up Covenant and leave to the right side of the map before you do this,
he's a good NPC and you can level him up too.By the way, I did this on the IP
10th Anniversary Edition of the game, in DOS. If you do get caught, just exit
fight them, exit without saving and start again, your perception only goes up
to Lvl 3 tho.

<p />
<em>Commentary by E. Needhammer <!-- Earl --> (July 2, 1999)</em><br />
In Quartz, on the "roof" next to Ugly's hideout (Where you use the rope to 
climb up, and then bust through the glass to the floor below)... if you set 
up a macro for your party to move up and down IMMEDIATELY next to the glass, 
you will not only push their perception to 3, but you also gain Experience 
AFTER their perception's topped off. And this works ANY time. Its a slow 
level-gainer, but it is a level gainer. Basically, you go to the glass "You 
see figures moving... ...surprise them", then set up your macro (I started at 
the top of the "glass" amd worked down, then back up, so that macro looked 
like "Down (x10), up (x10)"; then hold the key down for a while, and radio. 
Good for beaucoup promotions early on, and maybe one or two after your crew 
has advanced higher.

Have you ever killed the
Red Ryder himself?  If you attack the juvies in HighPool next
to the river/lake when they laugh at you for falling in it, the Red Ryder
himself comes out with his bb gun.  If you kill the Red Ryder and then
loot his one measly clip, all of Highpool is destroyed.
The dorms are abandoned, the shop closes, you no longer have access
to the cheapest doctor in the Wasteland, and the place looks messed up.
I always thought of it as destroying the peace of HighPool symbolized by
killing the Red Ryder.  Weird.

get a hold of an actual Red Ryder BB gun.

<em>Question by Ranger <!-- Richard --> Wolf, November 4, 2002</em><br />
I read a few years ago in the Gaming Tipps corner of a gamers magazine called
"ASM", that if you kill the night terror in Finster's mind maze you would get
this gun, which should be the absolute best in the game and only using 7.62
ammo. Is there something true about this, or why is it so legendary (you can
get it the gun in fallout from a random enounter)?

Hey Ranger Ben! It's me again, I noticed that one of my 
tricks wasn't on your board. Thats very sad, it's one of
the most useful there is! It allows you to rest as long as
you like without being attacked, great if you are wounded.
<p />
It's like this-if you have a "dummy character," like the 
ones you disband forever right after you get them (Jackie)
they can be extremely useful to you. Take them somewhere
(I found the area just east of Ranger HQ the best. To get
there enter, exit and go right.) and leave them there. Then
play with your real group and do what you normally do. Then
when you get really injured badly (Vegas Sewers) heal them
back to UNC and switch back to the "dummy." Then let time 
pass. As long as they don't die or get UNC'ed then the other
group won't be switched back to and they won't be aatcked!
I found this really useful. But in base Chocise you need to
have all four parties toghter so this would be almost a 
death sentence to your one, lone character. So add them or
ditch them before getting too far inside. Thats all!

<p />
<em>August 7, 1996</em><br />
I recently discovered a new "cheat" that works on the apple // emulator
version and perhaps others. It only works once, though, and the party
must not be carrying any gas masks for the cheat to work.  Here it is:
<p />
If you carry a corpse or two when you chat with Fat Freddy and refuse to
accept his job offer, you'll be gassed and taken to the prison northeast
of Vegas. At this point, you'll notice that your dead companions have
been brought back to life! Then it's only a matter of using dexterity on
yourself (several attempts may be necessary) and you'll be able to move
freely about the cell. Use picklock on your cellmate and hire him.
Covenant will get rid of the block of concrete that obstructs your way out.
<p />
The resurrected characters usually have a constitution of 1 but
occasionally they have 255 constitution. The cheat is probably related
to the bug that makes negative skill points possible.

<strong>Platform: </strong> All?
<p />
Many Ranger parties have noticed that sometimes there just ain't
enough servo motors to complete the game.  Specifically, it takes
quite a few to build the robot Max.  Here's where they are, and if you've
looked there, and still don't have enough, consider yourself the unlucky
recepient of a bug in the game.  Sometimes there just ain't enough!

<p />
Stagecoach Inn:
<br />
<ul>
<li>One is in Ellen's sister's wheelchair, who is waiting for you in 
  one of the rooms for which Ellen gives you a key.  If you kill her, you
  can get the servo motor.</li>
<li>Another is in the cabinets in the housekeepers room.</li>
</ul>

<br />
Sewers:
<ul>
<li>The rest are scattered throughout the sewers.</li>
</ul>

<br />
Super Loot Bag:
<ul>
   <li>If anyone finds one in the super loot bag trick (<a href="#superlootbags"
      >c.f.</a>) then let me know.
  This would be a good solution to the problem,
  if there aren't enough elsewhere.</li>
</ul>
<p />
The only other way to get past not building Max is to restart the maps.
Just kick butt with your characters through what you've already done, and
hope that the restarting of the maps will give you the motors you need to
build Max.
<p />
<em>Commentary by R. <!-- Richard--> Clayton (May 14, 2000)</em>
<br />
Hi there. I noticed that there's a section in the Wasteland
Underground that implies that you need to collect servo motors from all
over the game to rebuild Max in the sewers. In my experience, this is
not correct. I have played through both the Apple II and IBM PC version
several times, and always found enough servo motors in the sewers to
finish the section- even if I entered the sewers without any motors in
my possession.

The skill silent move helps in a few places in the game.  Only one character

it helps is when you sneak up on Louie in the Courthouse.  Silent movement
won't get Danny killed as often.
<p />
<em>Commentary by C. Vickers <!-- Codie --> (October 5, 1998)</em><br />
In Vegas, at Spade's Casino, there is a loose board you can step over if you
make a perception check. Save the game and stand on the loos board and just
wait (esc) over and over.  This will increase your silent move AND

   >Snake Squeezins</a> (April 24, 2003) 
<p />
Hi Rangers,
Like some, I either "skipped over some of the fine detail" OR just forgot it - 
so for the benefit of all, here's the info from the computer at Sleeper Base -
<p />
Wild Bill 
<p />
SLEEPER BASE - Level 3, - Room in the N.W. corner has a "Computer Terminal" to 
access Personnel Records or Files for the base's personnel. 
<p />
1) Smith - # 52 Col. John Smith's personnel file flashes up onto the screen. 
Aside from a large amount of test scores and other data, an occasional paragraph 
of interest slides by. One that catches your eye reads, in part, "After the 
confrontation with Finster concerning the shift of Darwin's focus, Smith requested 
and got a transfer to the Base 2 operation. He remained acting commander until 
the project's completion in 1995."
<p />
2) Edsel - # 40 Maj. Harrison Edsel's personnel file flashes up onto the 
screen. Aside from a large amount of test scores and other data, an occasional 
paragraph of interest slides by. One that catches your eye reads, in part, "The 
discipline problem with Edsel has resolved itself. Once he learned he would be 
transferred to Base Cochise to program that computer with his new artificial 
intelligence routines, he stopped complaining about the primitive rules restricting 
his creativity on this project.-
<p />
3) Cite - # 100 Maj. Peregrine Cite's personnel file flashes up onto the 
screen. Aside from a large amount of test scores and other data, an occasional 
paragraph of interest slides by. One that catches your eye reads, in part, "Peregrine 
accurately assessed the security problems with the storage area. While the base 
is not meant to be an armed camp, his precautions are well noted and should 
provide a surprise for unauthorized personnel operating in the base."  -  (the 
"electrified" corridor &amp; bots at the end !)
<p />
4) Thomas- # 63 Capt. Phil Thomas's personnel file flashes up onto the screen. 
Aside from a large amount of test scores and other data, an occasional 
paragraph of interest slides by. One that catches your eye reads, in part, "Thomas, a 
recent transfer from Project Darwin, has expressed reservations about Finster's 
experiments. He voiced some of the same objections to them that prompted me to 
leave Darwin. I don't know if he's on the level, or if this is some trap set by 
Finster..."
<p />
5) Mills - # 70 Capt. Andrea Mills's personnel file flashes up onto the screen. 
Aside from a large amount of test scores and other data, an occasional 
paragraph of interest slides by. One that catches your eye reads, in part, 'Despite her 
having won the Nobel last year, Andrea's relationships with the other project 
members have not changed. She's still her affable self, and she's made others 
feel, through their work on the clone pods, they've each earned a piece of that 
Nobel themselves."  -  (the Clone Pods work !)
<p />
6) Beams - # 91 Dr. Franklin Beams's personnel file flashes up onto the screen. 
Aside from a large amount of test scores and other data, an occasional 
paragraph of interest slides by. One that catches your eye reads, in part, "Dr. Beams's 
assessment of Edsel's obsessive behavior concerning the computer and AI just 
works as another nail in Edsel's coffin. The faster I can get him out of here, 
the better. Let Cochise's boss deal with a fully-aware computer."
<p />
7) Heller- # 101 Lt. Russel Heller's personnel file flashes up onto the screen. 
Aside from a large amount of test scores and other data, an occasional 
paragraph of interest slides by. One that catches your eye reads, in part, "I thought 
Heller would be a discipline problem, but he's not. His jokes relieve the 
tension as we work to finish this base. Others worry about the news that Edsel's new 
computer is helping to finish Cochise all by itself, but Heller shrugs it off. 
Who wants to work with someone who won't sit down for a cold beer after the 
work's done anyway?' Perhaps mankind does stand a chance against superior 
machines."

Here is a listing of the various sounds of Wasteland, as gleaned from users
across the world who've posted on the subject to Snake Squeezins.
<p />
<strong>Platform:</strong> Apple //

   <li>air raid siren during the beginning sequence</li>

   <li>the explosions are better [than the other platforms]--they sound like
   explosions!</li>

   <li>the Gieger counter clicking noise</li>
   <li>click upon moving or resting once</li>
   <li>the promotion jingle</li>
</ul>

<strong>Platform:</strong> Unknown -- help me place these sounds in the right
version!
<ul>
   <li>klaxons wailing in the beginning of the game</li>
   <li>the satellite blipping out nuclear spots</li>
</ul>
The general consensus at Snake Squeezins seems to be that the Commodore
version had the best sounds.  Now if anyone can record these sounds I'll post
them here and we can compare and contrast!  I for one have never played
Wasteland's Apple // or C= versions so all I have in my head are the IBM-PC
sounds.

<strong>Hole #1: super loot bags.</strong>
<p />
You can get these at the ACAPULCO club (that's the password) in needles, or
at Fat Freddy's in vegas. Go to a chair, gamble till you win, and leave the
cash. Now go to the next open chair (slot machine) and gamble till you win.
Don't take the cash yet. Go back to the first cash bag, take it, and drop
any item in anyone's inventory. Now go to the second bag, get it, and press
the down arrow. When it locks up, just hit escape. You can get all the items
in the game, and others. The best two others are <a
   href="#redryder">Red Ryders</a>, which are 7.62
rifles with 63 shots, and a range from 600-800 damage, and a thing that looks
like <a href="#armor">NAME AC</a>.
Select the name ac and if it says unjam?, select no, and equip
it. you now have a 127 armor level (only shows 27). If it doesn't, redo the
process. Only the <a href="#redryder">Red Ryder</a> will always be a weapon,
the other times can shift, and they are not worth getting.

<p />
<em>Commentary by Michael Cribbs</em><br />
I know that the cheat works if you do the following at the Acapulco
club: disband 1 character (with a <a href="#gambling">Gambling skill</a>),
go to the first chair and
gamble until you win, leave the money at the chair, go to the next chair and
gamble until you win, then leave the money at that chair, then go back to
the first chair and take the money, before going to the second chair Drop
some item from your inventory(such as 9 MM ammo clip), then when you go to
the loot at the second chair the computer freezes, hit the down arrow then
escape (you sometimes have to hit escape more than once) and presto you can
have as many <a href="#redryder">Red Ryder BB guns</a>
or Proton Ax's as you want.

<p />
<em>Commentary by S. Sedmak <!-- Stephen --> (March 14, 1996)</em><br />
I can't *quite* get the "Super Loot Bag" cheat to work for Wasteland.
I've tried it in both Acapulco and Fat Freddy's.
Both times I get a loot bag that is empty.  When I hit the down arrow and 
Escape, it does the same exact thing any bag would -- it exits.  When I come
back nothing has changed.  I get the feeling that something is there, and I've
almost got it.
<p />
Any suggestions?  I've got an ApplePC image right at this point and am 
willing to send it to anyone who can solve this mystery.

<p />
<em>Commentary by Black Raven (January 16, 1997)</em><br />
Sorry, the super loot bag trick is an IBM-specific bug, it looks like us
64/Apple II users are out of luck.  I really wanted those <a
   href="#redryder">Red Ryders</a> too!

<p />
<em>Commentary by Ranger Alec (November 11, 1997)</em><br />
If you push down on the fourth (I think) section of chain fence on the
southern border of the hotel in Quartz, it will give you a message about
loot being hidden under a chair, you then get a loot bag that contains
the same goodie you get in the much more complicated
<a href="#gambling">gambling</a> trick!  Enjoy!

<p />
<em>Commentary by Doomster (November 24, 1997)</em><br />
I am wondering if there are different versions of
Wasteland (on the IBM-PC).  The reason is because of the 
following differences that I noticed between the game I 
played and the ones people have been writing about:
<ol>
  <li>To use the SuperLootBag, I do not need to "drop" an item from my
      inventory.  All I need to do is to disband a character, look at the
      char's inventory once, and then go to the loot bag, which will freeze
      up, and then have many items after I press the ESC key.</li>
  <li>The NAME AC item (<a href="#armor">armour</a>) only gives me 26,
  not 27 armor.</li>
</ol>

<p />
<em>Commentary by Fat Boy (June 27, 1998)</em><br />
i thought about the super loot bag trick and how the computer works.  
the way i got the super loot bag trick to work is i got the empty loot 
bag.  i pressed the right arrow instead of down and i could cycle 
through all the stuff that included such things as 5 russian and 3 
female.  i have an idea why that happens, but i still need to hack in to 
wasteland to verify my hypothesises.  i noticed a lot of people think 
you have to press down and escape when the computer locks up.  that 
doesn't do much but confuse the computer.  just a little note.

<p />
<em>Commentary by V. Caine <!-- Venato --> (September 22, 1998)</em><br />
For the Super Loot Bag Trick, you don't have to (well I don't at least
=) ).  Disband a character or drop an item, I just gamble and win, don't
take the cash, play again and win, don't take the cash, go to the
original bag and take the cash, then scroll through a characters info
screen, go to the second bag and select the character i scrolled
through, and press down, viola.  I've noticed that the loot bags I got
in Freddy's and in the Acapulco Club contained slightly different items,
not sure if this is random or what, haven't tested it.

<p />
<em>Commentary by Shawn (January 1, 1999)</em><br />
Hi, I have some info on the super loot bags. There was a suggestion earlier
about a superloot bag located in the chain link fence at the Stagecoach Inn,
but that only works after you get the one in the Acapulco Club, or at least
thats what I've discovered. Also in Room #12 (I believe) of the Stagecoach
Inn, talk to the hobo in the corner, ask him about MONEY and he'll tell you
there's something hidden in the chair. Use a character with good perception
skill and use it over the chair (with space bar) and you'll get the superloot
bag also. I have a hunch this one might work without going to the Acapulco
Club first, because of the hobo's advice.

<p />
<em>Commentary by Freeman (February 11, 1999)</em><br />
I think this is the correct way to get a super loot bag in the Stagecoah
Inn: First, enter a room full of bums, fend them off and talk to the bum
in the corner. Ask him about MONEY. He will tell that some money in hidden
under the chair. Go get the money. If you now go walking right next to the
eastern end of the southern fence  (three or four spaces from the wall I
think) you'll get a message about loot hidden under a chair and find a
super loot bag.

<p />
<em>Commentary by V (June 10 1999)</em><br />
I was foolin' around, and I got the Super Loot Bags...so naturally I 
grabbed some <a href="#redryder">Red Ryders</a> and some <a
   href="#armor">Name AC</a>'s. The odd thing is, though, is the 
NAME AC refused to work as <a href="#armor">armor</a>,
and instead, is a melee weapon. But the 
thing thats messed up is how the power level fluxuates between battles. In 
Base Cochise, it did over 980 damage to some VTOL guns, killing them 
instantly, in Vegas it did only 20 damage to a Slicer Dicer in one fight, and 
then over 50 in the next.

<p />
<em>Commentary by WindWalker (December 14, 1999)</em><br />
I wanted to add my $0.02 about the Super Loot Bag. The way I've gotten
it to work is:
<p />
Bet at one of the chairs in the Accapulco Club until you win.<br />
Don't take the loot.<br />
Bet at one of the other chairs in the Accapulco Club until you win, then
take the pooled loot. This creates a glitch in that there's a loot bag
with nothing in it.<br />
Setup one party member so that they don't have any items in their
inventory. (i.e. Temporarily give everything to other party members.)<br />
Have the party member with no items look in the empty loot bag.
There will be nothing there at first. But if you press IJKLM, suddenly
the glitch shows itself and you can get the <a href="#redryder">Red Ryder

<em>Commentary by A. Knight <!-- Andy --> (July 14, 2002)</em><br />
Another Super Loot Bag exists that I didn't find on your site.  (DOS
Version) In the restaurant in Needles (where the roaming musician follows
you from table to table) buy some Snake Squeezins from the salesman.  Don't
pick it up.  Step to the East side of the salesman and buy another Snake
squeezins.  Then go pick up the first SS you purchased and the second one
becomes a Super Loot Bag.

This isn't a cheat, but it's definately cool.
In the sea of blood under the chessboard in the blood temple,
if you swim out to one of the walls of the big room that
surrounds the water, and run into it a couple of times, the game
will give you a message.

<p />
I am wondering if anyone else has ever encountered this particular bug.
It occured on the C64. Twice, as I was resting in the desert map northwest
corner, up there next to Base Cochise, I have been attacked and when 
presented a list of targets, was offered both the Desert Dwellers which
attacked me, AND tombstones. The tombstones that mark a dead character's
constitution bar, the icons, that is.
<p />
Anyhow, I Meson Cannoned the tombstones. As the computer was awarding 
experience points, the bug continued, and some characters were awarded
random amounts of experience. The computer even awarded experience to 
nonsense named characters. For example, the reward scrolling might read
'Ace gains 1000000 experience, 1 gains 2 experience, Killer gains 23563
experience, $#51 gains 32623 experience' et cetera. 
<p />
Not only did the game award these insane experience points, it also glitched
and altered character attributes. I had a character come out of this bug
with an 88 Strength, a 233 Luck, and a 35764 MAXCON!
<p />
Anyone else ever found this?
<p />
<em>Commentary by Black Raven (January 16, 1997)</em><br />
As far as the tombstones, I checked into it with a 64 and determined that it
must have been a bug (a bad copy will do it sometimes).

<em>Commentary by Doomster (November 24, 1997)</em><br />
In Ugly John's stronghold (NE of the Courthouse),
I cannot find the safe.  I have a character with a Level 4 
Perception and after one hour of looking at the map
on the wall, the char could not find a safe hidden behind
that map.  I take it that this "safe" does not exist in the IBM-PC
version?

<p />
<em>Commentary by Christian (September 16, 1998)</em><br />
I did
find out that the Ugly's safe does exist in the PC version, you need to have
level 3+ character with level 3+ perception, one way to get it is to go to the
secret entrance to Ugly's and walk up and down along the windows above his
hideout, you will have everyone in your party gain both experience for each
step and have a good chance of raising your perceptions up to 3. You can use
this just like the trash in the basement in Vegas for experience/level
building, but most PCs will not cycle fast enough to hold down the macro
button for moving up and down, only way I know around this is to set the
keyboard to 1 cps (clicks per second) in the computer's CMOS setup.

<p />
<em>Commentary by S. Smith <!-- Simon --> (August 21, 1998)</em><br />
I couldn't find the safe either, and I remembered it quite clearly.
That's why I spent a good amount of time with a 5 in observation
[he means perception --Ranger Ben] looking everywhere.
<p />
When I went back for a third time (after finding this site and reading
the <a href="#walkthroughs">walkthroughs</a> to see if I was imagining things),
I found it simply by walking along the wall.
<p />
Go figure.

<p />
<em>Commentary by Ranger Adam (February 5, 1999)</em><br />
I think I may have an answer about the problem with Ugly's safe in his
hideout. I've been able to both find the safe and not find it while playing
the version off of the CD. I think it's the install program that is used to
copy all the game files to HD that screws it up (bad copy or something like
that). What I've both doing (mostly because I was lazy and didn't want to go
thru all the hoops to get the front-end program running) is copy all the files
off the CD then paste them to a directory on the HD (if you're using
Win95/98). Then after copying them, select all, go to properties and unselect
read-only. This should fix the problem. Also I think this fixes the problem
with only one Onyx ring. But it's been a little while since I've played the
game, though I'm quite positive that procure will fix both problems.

<p />
<em>Commentary by Freeman (February 11, 1999)</em><br />
About the safe behind the map in Ugly John's hideout. In the newer version
it is still there, but can only be spotted through passive use of
perception skill, So just walk back and forth in front of the map. I
spotted it when I was playing the game through the second time with same
characters.

<p />
<em>Commentary by J. Compton <!-- Jason --> (January 25, 2000)</em><br />
Please contribute this to the Ugly John's Stronghold thread in the
Wasteland Underground, and the "versions of Wasteland" thread, because the
conclusion there is obviously wrong:
<p />
The safe is always there in Ugly John's hideout. You guys are all so
experienced now you probably never create characters with the -Safecrack-
skill. Perception will work, but Safecrack works better. I discovered
this in a game I just started playing...I knew perfectly well that a safe
was there but it didn't show up. Finally, I found it, complete with a
Safecrack Level 2 bonus for the character that figured it out.
<p />
Why would safeCRACK be useful for finding a safe? I don't know, why do
broken toasters contain laser guns?

<p />
<em>Commentary by J. Liao <!-- Jason --> (March 1, 2000)</em><br />
I've just walked next to the map in the hideout, and it raised my PICKLOCK
skill to 6. I had been trying to search for it with perception before,
and it hadn't worked, but perhaps it is the picklock skill that counts.
Also, the fact that it was able to raise my skill to 6 means that it was
sufficiently "difficult" to spot, which explains why most rangers won't
find it in the beginning of the game, when they probably have a picklock
skill of 1.
<p />
I have the version without the Onyx Ring in the Citadel (either that, or
it's really well hidden), so the theory that it was excluded in later
versions may not be quite true after all.

<em>Commentary by Mike (January 16, 1997)</em><br />
Get plenty of money (enough to cure rad. poisoning for all your guys).
Disband all but one party member into a radiation area (catch radiation
poisoning). The area around darwin village is good. Now add them back
to the one guy (that isn't poisoned). Have the poisoned members drop
their canteens and armor; walk around the desert until they are in
serious or worse condition. (Make sure your one unpoisoned guy is 
good at medic or doctor; if you don't have one, it's easy to scoot
into Vegas and get Mike Scott or Convenant). Now when these guys are 
hurting enough, save the game (trust me). Now exit and use the master
disks to reset the maps (make sure the characters are saved!). Now
when you start the game again, bring them back up to UNC using the
medic or doctor skills. Walk over to Highpool, and have them cured.
When your guys wake up, the number in the CON column should be much
higher than the MAX. Now they have almost infinite CON points, and 
can take a real beating.
<p />
*Note* this life will run out, but it shouldn't for a few thousand or
so points (enough to let you storm guardian citadel with a club). When your
life reaches zero; it will reset and go back to 999.
<p />
There you go. I think that's how it worked, but as I said, I don't have
a computer to test it out on, but it should be o.k. Let me know how it
works out; feel free to edit my directions. Just want to spread the 
knowledge.

Someone else tried the Wasteland version that was on the 
Interplay CD.  He too couldn't find the safe in Ugly John's
hideout.  He remembers that on an older PC version, he could.
<p />
It looks like there are two versions of the PC Wasteland out
there.  One is the one that has a safe behind the picture in
Ugly John's hideout and has two Onyx rings in the game (one 
of them being in the Guardian Citadel).  The other (latter
version, the one I have) has no safe behind the picture and
has no Onyx ring in the Guardian Citadel.
<p />
Can anyone think of any more?

<em>Commentary by Desert Ranger Vince of the 56th "Anti-Mutie" squad</em>
(October 2, 1998)<br />
Using my cheapness and diabolacle mind, i figured out a way to get the 1989
NATO assault rifles while i was still a Private! Haha! Get this...
<p />
Go sell off all of your stuff besides your canteen and a few 45 clips.
Go truckin' down to the Junkmaster Village and use the password, REDHAWK.
Hit the ammo-shed first, and try to crack open the chest w/out being poisoned.
Get the MAC-17 and kill off the gaurds outside (tip: use full-auto), taking
their UZI and giving it to another Ranger, and then break into their armory
(the one above) and taking the two M1989A1's from the gun shed. Equip those
and fight your way out of the village (killing women and children was never so
fun while you're packing assault-rifle vengeance) using the UZI, MAC-17, and
the two NATO's. You should pick up a few more rifles from the loot of the
Scavs while you leave Junkmaster's Village. 
<p />
There...you just got two SMG's, a couple of the BEST ASSAULT-RIFLES IN THE
GAME, and there should be some grenades and spears too (spears: the low-cost
alternative to a LAW Rocket), while you're still a PRIVATE. I bet you feel
good, eh?

<p />
<em>Commentary by Desert Ranger Vince of the 56th "Anti-Mutie" squad</em>
(October 3, 1998)<br />
A low-cost alternative for RPG-7s and LAW Rockets to storm the Citadel is
Covenant and several spears. I found this out when i heard Spears were a good
Anti-Tank weapon and especially destructive when used with a strong character
w/ high dexterity, a.k.a. Covenant (DEX:20, STR:20,AT Skill:3). While my other
characters were fumbling and wasting valuable rockets, Covenant wasted Brother
Goliath and Sister Jade with only one hit each. Covenant also managed to land
a few hits on the Scorpitron with a spear. So, if you're low on cash and need
something destructive....go get Covenant and a spear!

<hr />

<a id="weaponskilltips"><span class="darkred">weapon skill tips</span></a>
<p />
<em>Commentary by Zoster (July 1, 1999)</em><br />
I do have a trick for you to use if you wish. It
helps to get any weapons skill up to 7 (mainly assult rifle and Energy
Weapons). Arm your party with NATO's or AK's and kevlar or
better. Go to the Scorpitron (hopefully not defeated) and auto it.
You should do none-to-minimal damage and increase in skill quickly.
The Energy Weapons one works well in the citadel, as does the assult rifles
[one].  Go through the game a few times and see your party with
10 Assult Rifle and 10 Energy Weapon.
