Welcome to
<u><strong><font color="purple">Launch Code: MOTEKIM!</font></strong></u>
This sub-page of The
Wasteland Ranger HQ-Grid is dedicated to you, the fans of Wasteland, the
most intelligent comptuer game players and creators in the world.  I hope
you remembered to pack your I.Q., and maybe your LUCK, too, because you're
going to need them here!
<p>
I got the idea for Launch Code: MOTEKIM!, as you might suspect, from scanning
the <u>Paragraph Book</u>.  As you know, there are many passwords, real and
fake, scattered throughout the pages of that paperback companion to Wasteland.
If you didn't know which paragraphs were the "real" ones, it would be a
guessing game as to which were real, and which lead to certain doom if
entered at the Wasteland prompt.
<p>
After drinking one too many Dr. B. Bilious Balfour's Snake Squeezins one
night, it occurred to me that perhaps it might be fun to host my own
little game of guessing, and the like, on a monthly basis.
Thus this page was born.
<p>
Rangers who submit correct answers to each new puzzle
will have their names listed below.  I will assign a rank to each participant
based on the number of puzzles they solve correctly.  Ranks will correspond
to the <a href="uground-con.html#ranks">ranks attainable in the Wasteland
game</a> (what else?).  So, without further rambling, let us proceed!  Don't
let your friends beat YOU to the rank of Supreme Jerk!
<p>
(Pssst!  If you missed a puzzle,
you can always submit your answers at any time.  I'll trust that you
didn't look at the posted solution....)

Ranger Ben's Mind Maze<br>
(Not quite as deadly as Finster's Mind Maze, but probably more
annoying)</strong>
<p>
We'll start off with an "easy" one.  [toothy grin]
The following passwords (real and fake, extracted from the <u>Paragraph
Book</u>) have been scrambled.  Can you guess what the real
passwords are?  As an added twist, I have inserted spaces and / or
symbols in the scrambled passwords.  (If you need help, consult
the <u>Paragraph Book</u>.  There's a link to it at the <a
href="underground.html">Wasteland Underground</a>.)
<p>
Once unscrambled, if you can also tell me which of the below
passwords are real
and which are fake, your name will be entered into a drawing for
a date with everyone's favorite desert Uzi-toting babe-of-a-Ranger,
Christina!  (Well, not really, but wouldn't that be fun?)
<p>
<ol>
  <li><code>TOM &amp; MIKE</code>
  <li><code>LATER, PC LIAR!</code>
  <li><code>HOT AN' SAT</code>
  <li><code>HER MOMMY &amp; I STAND</code>
  <li><code>TO: MA'</code>
</ol>

<p>
Congratulations to John Toomey who won the date with Christina!  John was
selected from a pool of seven entrants who had correct answers and also
noted which passwords were real and which were fake.  John and
Christina went to the Acapulco club, where they danced, played poker,
and traded Ranger School stories.  They finished off a lovely evening
by going brahmin-tipping.  Sounds like they had a great time!

Grizzly Death Announcement Scramble</strong>
<p>
In this installment, I've scrambled some of
the rather awful sounding death announcements displayed when one of
your Rangers polishes off one of his foes.  Your job?  Match each
introduction in the left column with its proper conclusion in the right
column.
<p>
<font color="red">Note:</font> No assumptions
should be made about a one-to-one mapping of beginnings and endings.  In
other words, each ending might or might not be matched exactly one time,
and each beginning might or might not have an ending to go with it.

Ooooh that was sneaky of me!  I should've raffled off a prize for that one.
It took most (but not all!) people who attempted it a couple of times to get
them all right.

Finish the Secret Sequences</strong>
<p>
In this puzzle, you are tasked with finishing these sequences of numbers.
All of these sequences are directly related to some aspect of the game
Wasteland, or the post-nuclear war theme in general.
It is up to you to figure out what the sequence is, and then fill in the
missing elements!  Hint: These sequences of numbers can be found in
one or more of the following
sources: the game Wasteland, the <u>Survival Guide</u>, the <u>Paragraphs</u>
Book, or the <u>Manual</u>.
<p>
Note: I consider this puzzle to be TOUGH.  In case I don't get to a new
puzzle any time soon, I wanted to make sure you all stayed busy.  :)
<p>
<ol>
  <li type="A">11, 16, __
  <li>32, 512, __
  <li>2, 3, 4, 4, 5, 7, 8, __, 14, 15, 16, 19, __, 21, 22, 22, __,
      22, 24, 24, 25, 26, 26, 26, 27, 27, __
  <li>31, 17, __, 07, 99
</ol>

<font color="red">Here's a hint.</font>  Part C's sequence is actually one of at
least two versions of this sequence.  Depending on which platform of Wasteland
you have (the original Apple ][, the Commodore 64 or the IBM-PC), the
elements of this sequence vary.

Well, only two Rangers, (now) Specialist Luthen Iruun and Private First Class
George Shannon, completed this puzzle correctly.  I waited more than nine
months to see if anyone else would answer the puzzle, and no one has.  So,
sorry to say, although it was fun for me to make the puzzles, and hopefully,
fun for those who answered the puzzles, I'm hanging up the radioactive game
show hat.  But it could come back by popular demand (or if I get really
bored)!
