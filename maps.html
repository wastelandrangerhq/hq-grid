As an introduction to this map museum, I must give credit to Nishan Hossepian,
one of creators of the game Wasteland, who programmed a bunch of the maps
for the game.  He visited the HQ-Grid back in 1996 and was quite impressed
that there is such a great fan following of this game he helped to create.
Feel free to send me any more of Hossepian's creations for all to see on the
HQ-Grid!

<center><h3>Map of The Wasteland</h3></center>
Here it is!  It is the complete map of the Wasteland as seen in the game,
as scanned in and with annotations by
<a href="mailto:alex.p@kitz.netwing.at">Alexander J. Pirchl</a>,
the honored Austrian
Ranger.  No Ranger will want to be without this map of the Wasteland!  But
a spoiler alert first--not all areas on the map can be seen at the beginning of
the game (especially the radioactive ones)....

<center><h3>Map of Highpool</h3></center>
Austrian Ranger Pirchl has once again used his talents from Map Skills/Geography
101 trainer in Ranger School (c.f. <a href="chronicles/tfwl.html">Tales From the
Wasteland</a>) in compiling the complete map for HighPool, usually any
brave ranger party's first exploration.  This map also has spoilers to locations
not readily seen...  Many thanks to Alexander for his excellent "drawing."
