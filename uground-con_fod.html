Both FoD and WL run fine under Windows 2000 Professional
RC2. Just don't try to switch to another application.

<em>Commentary by V (November 26, AD 1999)</em><br>
I found out a neat-ass way to get free guns. When you go to the Miami PD,
and they ask if you've got their guns, say "Yes" when you don't,
and a large group of punks will attack (Informers). Simply throw the plastique
they gave you in the beginning at them, and you'll blow them all to hell
and get plenty of free pistols and ammo.
