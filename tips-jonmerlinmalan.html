    <p>These Wasteland game tips from Jon "Merlin" Malan have seen the
    light of day on many, now defunt, web sites.  He sent them to 
    me for safe keeping since they had been taken down from the site
    where he'd last seen them.  Thanks to Jon for the trust.  Here are
    his tips.</p>

Look, I know this game is a bit old, but it's still one of the best post-
holocost RPG's out there.  Cheet38.zip contained a pretty good hint file 
for this game, but there were a few things left out that needed mentioning.
</p>
<p>
Proton Axe: This makes not only a great weapon, but it can also be used to 
chop down doors that usually take TNT or rockets to open. Also, there are 
actually at least TWO of them in the game!  The obvious one is in the 
Guardian Citadel, but there is also one in Las Vegas.  In a little building
with an entrance in the north, found right by the Scorpitron, the walls 
inside form the letters "P. A." The building is approx. one block directly 
east of the scorp, on the south side of the street.
</p>
<p>
Not many people know this, but the Night Terror, found inside Finster's Brain,
is the most valuable kill in the whole game, worth 32,000 exp. (or 64,000 if 
fought hand-to-hand).  He eats AK-47 shots for breakfast, and can shrug off 
a meson cannon full auto at least twice, but he can't really hurt you much 
if you have AC 10 or 14.  I reccommend setting a macro to speed things up,
hitting it with 2 or 3 clips of lasers or 4 clips of AK, then chopping away 
with a chainsaw or a proton axe until the stubborn thing dies. Promotions will
surely follow.
</p>
<p>
When you attack the Scorpitron in Las Vegas, approach him from the North or
South side, so that you start out only 50' away instead of 90'.  It makes for
much more accurate shots.
</p>
<p>
If your low-level group keeps getting the crap pounded out of them in quartz
and needles, try this: at the secret entrance to Ugly's hideout in Quartz, 
walk up and down the glass wall repeatedly (macros are great for this.) Not 
only will it raise everyone's perception, it also raises their experience for 
using that skill.  Enough times will earn a few free promotions at low levels, 
but it only works before you break the glass, so don't break it until you're
really ready.
</p>
<p>
There are two spots in the mine shaft where you can use metallurgy skill to 
find silver veins "the rocks here look strange".  afterward, using a pickax
will yield a few dollars, depending on your luck, with each use.  Good for 
those times when the Head Crusher eats your last Visa Card.
</p>
<p>
Cryptography skill is only used in Faran Brygo's place.  When you try to kill 
him, and you come to a place where there is a strange pattern on the wall, this 
skill lets you open up a passage with tons of RPG-7's, power packs, etc. inside
