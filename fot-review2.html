         The following is a reprint of an e-mail I received on October 22, AD
         2001, by J. Edgell.  For those of you who haven't seen Fallout
         Tactics yet, and are wondering what exactly it's like to play it,
         read on.

         <div class="section">Another Review of Fallout Tactics: Brotherhood of
            Steel</div>
         <p />
         Well most of us have played the Legendary "Wasteland."
         Most of us waited for years for a sequel and Fallout was
         born.  Fallout 2 soon followed: the RPG of the Year!
         Now its Fallout Tactics.  As we all know Interplay
         knows the right stuff in making an RPG with a post
         nuclear setting.  Only Interplay.   Fallout Tactics
         (FOT) is set as a sequel prequel.  Confusing isn't it?
         Well FOT in story is the sequel to Fallout and a
         prequel to Fallout 2.  Instead of being in the great
         Californ-i-a, you're in Chicago, home of the Cubs.  Well it
         used to be home.  Microforte developed most of the
         game.  They changed the game from just "Turn Based" to
         "Turn Based and Real Time Strategy".  You can switch the
         two during the game also.  Most of how the game is
         played is just like Fallout... most of it anyway. 
         You control a unit of men as the Brotherhood of Steel
         pretty much just shooting down whatever the Sargent
         tells ya to shoot.  20 missions is all you have.  A lot
         of the Fallout feel is taken away with lack of deep
         interaction and being able to go were you want to go. 
         The multiplayer function of FOT is the best of it all.  Up to
         17 players can play in one map at the same time! 
         Choose a human, mutant, ghoul, dogs, and even a
         Deathclaw.  You can also drive cars in the game such
         as a Hummer, tank, and many more.  So my overall review of
         this game is that if it is that classic Fallout you're
         looking for, then FOT took a rocket launcher and blew
         it away.  It is great for Online Gaming and I would recommend
         you playing to beat it if you are a Fallout
         completionist like I am.  I would give it a 6 out of
         10.  Just for a note: It is said that Fallout 3 will
         be out.  Lets just pray that its developed only by
         Interplay.

         <p />
