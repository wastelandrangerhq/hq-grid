 Dream Tales is the name given to the story for several reasons.  Each
 party in the story 'dreams'.  MOTHER, the chief protagonist, although an
 indirect protagonist, dreams of success in fulfilling her master's ultimate
 goal: world domination.  She is stopped.
 Vax was to become as human as possible, although in doing this he almost
 joined forces with the self-diluted agenda of MOTHER.  Vax will obviously
 never succeed in becoming human but now with his alliance with the Rangers
 may come as close as possible.
 Mov wanted to become a real Octotron.  Poor fella, he failed too.
 Wilfred wanted to find a nirvana-type heaven beyond the wall.  After he
 found out about the Wasteland, he was constantly fighting with his faith,
 his party, the barren desert, and this evil entity called MOTHER.
 The Christina Corp wanted to become real proven rangers.  They did it.
 Slaughter, Depeche, Fixer, and Afghan, once they met, wanted to stop MOTHER
 at all costs.  They did.
 Sparky wanted a computer upgrade.  He got it.  Good for Sparky.)
