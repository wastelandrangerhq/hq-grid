I pulled into Vegas on a Rockwell American V-12 Hovertank.  I had a Meson Cannon with Ace
Maloney's name written all over it.  I got into town only to find that somebody had already
croaked him.  How was I supposed to terminate someone who was already three feet under?  All
that 'extreme prejudice' gone to waste.
<p>
A man in Johnson Servotech power armor is hardpressed to squeeze any juice from the grapevine,
so I took the regulation flak-vest from underneath the gunner's seat of the V-12.  It was
safety-orange.  If that wasn't enough to mark me as a wasteland warrior with balls or a
deathwish or both, I don't what was.  Shouldering the Meson Cannon, I headed up the main
drag towards a sidewalk bar I knew from word of mouth.  It wasn't exactly a bar; it was
more like a cordon.  Hemp ropes and barbed wire defining a rough octagon around the bartender
who was orbited by a bunch of tiny makeshift tables like liquor-bearing satellites.  He was
a big Jamaican with a prosthetic lip, and it gave his voice a strange metallic lisp as he
motioned me over.
<p>
"What ya poithon, mon?"
<p>
"Rum, Captain Joe if you got it."  He hesitated for a moment, a look of doubt on his deep-set
eyes, until I pulled out a wad of twenties and peeled two off.  I put one on a little green
table where his cashbox was, and the other I stuffed into the breast pocket of his dirty mesh
shirt.  "And some conversation."
<p>
He shook his head, and handed me the twenty back with a look of disgust.  "That kinda
talk'll get ya in a world of hurt.  Thave it for thomeone elthe."  He handed me a glass with
a teeny shot of the Captain's rum, all that twenty would buy.  I shifted my Meson on the
leather Sam Browne I kept it on, and the Jamaican laughed.  I looked down and realized that
he had a tripod mounted M-60 beneath the long 1x6 that served as his bar.  It looked like
he had jury-rigged it with the foot pedal from a sewing machine.  All he had to do was
put his weight down a little, and a would-be tough customer would be exploded like a blood
sausage.  "Jah, don't even think about threaten I."
<p>
"Alright, give me a bottle of squeezin's."  I put the rejected twenty with its brother,
and he handed me a battered bottle of the milky squeezin's.
<p>
"Jah love, my brother," the barkeep laughed.
<p>
Downing the rum in one shot- it was excellent- I stowed the bottle of Snake Squeezin's,
and returned the shot glass to the plank, the barkeep's prosthetic chrome grin not wavering
for a second.
<p>
The strip was fairly empty for midday- I expected to be bothered by punks the moment
I stepped out of the Jamaican's little bivouac, but I could only see isolated pockets
of them in the distance.  The street toughs usually have enough sense to lay low when
they smell heavy action, so I figured that something was about to go down in this burg.
<p>
My luck was paying off today- no sooner than I had started walking along the street, I heard
a raspy voice croak out "Spare change, mistah?"
<p>
I looked off between two large brick buildings and into what resembled a vision of hell more
than an alley.  Looking at the figure who spoke, I thought he looked right at home.  The
hobo was lanky, and he'd obviously been tall at one point in his life, until his spine
had folded rather neatly over from some congenital deformity.  He was bald, his head covered
in sores, and his face, well, his face actually made me feel a twinge of pity.  Pitted,
pockmarked, covered with the lines of despair.  Lucky for me, I noticed that his mouth
was raw and red, and the stubble around it was bleached a spotty orange, one of the two
telltale signs of a habitual Snake Squeezin's drinker.  The other one was rigor
mortis.  "Spare change, mistah?  Come on?"  He was rubbing his hands desperately, and his
face went wide when I pulled out the bottle of squeezin's.
<p>
"Ah ah ah, naughty."  His face fell when I snatched the bottle back out of his reach.
"Tell me something first."
<p>
"Aw, mistah, you don' wanna, oh no, I mean, I , Come on mistah..."  He seemed to grow
breathless for a moment, but he was just saving up for the squeaky exclamation that followed.
"SQUEEEE-ZIN'S!"  He fell down, exhausted.
<p>
"What's going on in this town?  What's up?"
<p>
"Big reckoning, mistah.  Nothin' for a fine walkin' dude like yaself."
<p>
"Reckoning?  What the hell does that mean?  Freddy and Fargo at it again?"
<p>
"Naw,naw,naw," he said, shaking his head. He leaned forward conspiratorially, and whispered
"Ro-buts.  Deadly robuts."
<p>
I realized that this old hobo was telling the truth.  He was scared to death, and not
just of me.  I decided to press the matter just a little.
<p>
"What do you mean, robots?"
<p>
"Deadly robots, mistah!  Watch out!  They sneak right up on ya, like a tank with an
armored warrior!  Oh Gawd!"  He sneezed heavily, and wiped a huge green string of snot
on his sleeve.  "And then there was another fine walkin' dude like yaself."
<p>
I froze.
<p>
"What do you mean like me?"
<p>
"Nothin', nothin', aw it's nothin'.  Squeezin's?"
<p>
I gave him the bottle.  He snatched it right away, and was worrying the cork (actually
just waxy wads of bandage) from the bottle, all the while mumbling in his strange way.
"Yeah, yeah, yeah, come on, you ain't never done ol' Billy no harm, not like that dude,
oh no, ain't never seen somebody move so fast, aw no.  Shucks, puts hair on your chest,
he's a real badass.  Squeezin's, squeezin's..."  He tipped the bottle back, downing
it in one gulp.
<p>
A strange light grew in his eyes, and he drew himself up as tall as his spine would
let him.  "It's Latimer."  His voice was stronger, much clearer than his usual whine.
"There's the man. There's Latimer!"  He pointed behind me, back behind the alley,
before falling over into a squeezin's coma.
<p>
I spun, looking for Latimer, who must have been the 'dude like yaself', but I didn't
see anything, nothing but a fleeting shadow in the alley on the opposite side of the street.
<p>
The rest of the day was uneventful.  I spent it pumping information, and having no luck.
I did run into the deadly robots the hobo had mentioned.  They were just Warroids of
different Mark numbers, and in crappy condition.  No one took pride in their robot death
machines anymore, just letting them do their thing with no upkeep.  But I wasn't about to take
in the abandoned metallic darlings.  Not when they took potshots at me like a good killer
robot is supposed to!  A well placed shot to the actuation cluster takes out just about
any model of Warroid.  The exact spot is a secret though, and I'm glad I knew it.  Standing
in the middle of a Vegas street, in the middle of a smoking pile of Warroids, I heard a
strange noise.  It was clapping.  There were a bunch of gang punks huddled in a deadend alley.
The robots must have cornered them.  Besides clapping, they were smiling with relief and
admiration.  They stopped smiling when I leveled my Meson Cannon at them, and fired.
Then the only sound was the Zzzip! of the Meson and the dry sound of human disintegration.
No witnesses.  I had agendas.
<p>
Heading back to the V-12 for the night, I was plagued by thoughts of something the hobo had said.
First, the fact that he mentioned someone like me.  There was no one like me in this area
of the Wasteland.  No one from SourceGroup was qualified to tackle Florida, much less Vegas.
And there were no active agents on longterm assignments. I had clearance, and Mission
seniority.  I would have known anyone else active.
<p>
Why did the name Latimer sound so familiar?
<p>
*          *          *
<p>
Everyone always thought that Ace Maloney was the luckiest guy around.  I don't understand
why; if he was so freakin' lucky, then why did he have to live in the Wasteland?  Whatever
luck he did have, it ran out in Vegas before I got there.  That morning, after I woke up,
I pulled myself out of the V-12's bunk, and walked into town.  I found out then just
what happened to the doomed Ace.
<p>
He had his head blown off.
<p>
I ended up in an open-air bar on the roof of a large building.  I was talking to a Nomad
who had wandered in from the desert for a beer and some ammo.
<p>
"... and like I was saying, I was just getting some 9s for my Uzi when  these Rangers come
strolling in like they own the place-"
<p>
"Rangers?" I interrupted.  "Desert rangers?"
<p>
"Yeah, desert rangers, so like I was saying they come strolling in like they own the place,
buy all the 9s and 45s, all the grenades, and pawn a bunch of useless crap on the poor bastard
who runs the place.  That's when I noticed that Maloney was with 'em."
<p>
"How long ago was this?"
<p>
"Well, about a week ago.  Maloney was there, his usual cheeky self, hittin' on the shop
guy's daughter, that sort of thing.  Pissed us regulars off, ya know?"  He tossed his
head back and ran a hand through his dirty hair.  I nodded.
<p>
"Yeah, I know it."
<p>
"So anyway, I was saying-"
<p>
"Wait a second."  I interrupted again, and ordered another beer.  "How did you know Maloney?"
<p>
"I used to run with him four, five years ago.  I got tired of the lucky son-of-a-bitch.
He never got hit!  And always rippin' a clip... it's a wonder we ever made any money, what
with his ammo cost.  But lucky, I tell you."
<p>
"If he was so freakin' lucky, then why did he live in the wasteland?"
<p>
"Dunno," the nomad shrugged.  "Anyways, we split a while ago, no hard feelin's, and that's how
I knew him.
<p>
Guess he's got a good thing goin' with those Rangers."  I cursed under my breath.
Always faggot rangers interfering in other people's business.  They had the sophistication
and skill of those nutter survivalists that barely made it through the nukes.  Unfortunately,
they were just as resouceful, which meant they were just as armed.  I always did my best to
stay clear of Desert Rangers.
<p>
"Alright, skip a bit.  How did Ace get it?"
<p>
The nomad, Jerry was his name, actually looked a little grieved, and it took him a second to
get started.
<p>
I got him another beer, and that primed the pump.
<p>
"Well, see, I was in Spade's casino, just pumpin the slots with some money I took off a
coupla banditos near the rail camp.  And in walk the Rangers sure enough, with Ace.  They
were packin' serious heat, not just carrying it, they were wielding.  They barged in,
knockin' people over, makin' crude jokes, a real bunch of jerks.  They got to the middle of
the casino when the bouncers came over, and then the fireworks started.  I was hiding behind
a big slot machine, that's how I saw Ace.  He was leanin' up against the bar, which was
empty.  He musta forgot about the bartender or just plain didn't care.  The bartender was just
a little guy, bald and friendly like a grandpa. Well, Ace is standing there just as cocky
as ever, about to take a shot at a big bouncer, when I see the bartender's bald head pop up
over the bar, and it was followed by a Mac 17."  Jerry swallowed. "The little old guy grinned
and pulled the trigger, full auto.  Ace's head just exploded, spraying everywhere.  The other
rangers got the old guy, but... there was no more Ace.  When the cordite smoke cleared, I
didn't see anybody living.  The rangers were gone, and I just hightailed it on out of there.
Just practical, you know."  He tipped a beer back, but it was empty, and he started to get up.
<p>
"Hey, thanks for the info.  Sorry to hear about Ace."
<p>
"No problem, ya know..."  He shrugged.  "Negative sweat.  It wasn't like he was Supreme Jerk
or something."
<p>
"The Supreme Jerk is a fracking myth and you know it."  I only noticed when he pulled away
that I had gotten up and grabbed him.
<p>
"Hey, hey, jeez... I know.  Just makin' a joke, ya know.  No such thing as Supreme Jerk."
He brushed himself off and let a hand slip to his clip pistol.  "Damn, lay off the caffeine."
<p>
I sat back down as he left.  Why did that bother me so much?  Maybe it was just I didn't like
the idea of fairytales and myths... we had enough problems as it is, and enough assholes with
guns and know-how.  Nobody out there had anything on Source Group operatives, which made the
Supreme Jerk myth just a little bit more annoying.  The myth went that the Supreme Jerk was
immortal, a hardcase from pre-Wasteland days who could shoot, fight, drink, and repair a
toaster better than any man alive.  I knew the classics; He-man, Batman, Superman, Tick.
They were chock full of stuff like that.  The Supreme Jerk myth was supposed to be sinister,
and that was pretentious and annoying.  It must have just been that that bothered me.  But
why did it seem stranger than that?  Why did a combo of superhero and bogeyman that was
exaggerated by each generation of new squeezin's virgins shake me up so much?  It couldn't
be more than that.
<p>
I would soon learn that it just might be.  I was on my way to see Ol' Billy.
<p>
I found Ol' Billy in the alley where I first met him, the bottle of squeezin's that I had bought
broken on the ground.  Billy was face-down in a pool of blood.  One more semi-reliable
source of info gone.  Kind of sad, though his was a life I would gladly escape from in
death.  I flipped the corpse over, not expecting what I saw.  I figured that he had
probably just hemorrhaged in the night, from squeezin's, no doubt.  I didn't expect his
head to be half torn off, is face in a rictus of pain and fear.  I looked at the old face.
He didn't even find peace in death;  the face was scary itself.  I checked his limbs.
They were already in rigor, so he must have died in the night, alright.  Then I checked the
wound, and that's when I saw something strange.  A large portion of the top of his head
was gone, the tearing of the skin suggesting that it had been smashed off.  That in itself
wasn't unusual; any New Waver could come along with a sledgehammer and knock someone's block
off.  But not with a... my God.
<p>
I had seen a few strange markings near the wound, which would have been the print of the
object that killed him.  And at first I figured it was just some large pipe with and odd
fitting on the end.  I was thirsty suddenly, and when I brought out my canteen, something
clicked.  I put the rubber cap assembly to the wound.  The black rubber nubbin of the canteen
matched the prints of the wound.
<p>
This was scary.  I know I didn't do it.  The V-12 had perimeter alarms that would have gone off
if I were sleepwalking.  And the canteen wasn't just any old model.  It was unique to
SourceGroup, made back in the '90s for contaminated waste areas.  I'll say it again; there
were no SourceGroup agents in Nevada.  I was the only one.  And the chance that an agent
would have left his special Hermeticseal canteen was very slim.  And who had the strength
to tear someone's head off with a canteen?
<p>
Before I knew it I was running, God knows why, to anywhere.  Thoughts in my head were spinning
wildly.  I was all the way towards the middle of the city when the ground in front of me
erupted.  I tumbled to a stop, coming to rest in a low stance with my meson cannon out.
About ninety feet ahead, I saw a giant robot.  The worst kind of intelligent deadly robot.  A
Scorpitron.
<p>
The giant thing, a huge gunmetal colored scorpion-like robot, was poised in the middle of the
street, its enormous tail tipped with an energy weapon of some unkown designation.  That was
what knocked me down; it was big.  As I saw now that I wasn't running headlong, the rest
of the street ahead of me was cratered and pockmarked from the Scorpitron's fire.  I took
a couple shots at it, towards the head, tail, and servo-motors, but I must have been in bad
shape, because I didn't hit the damn thing once.  It fired at me again, and the only way to
dodge shots like that is in great big leaps and bounds.  I kept doing that, trading fire
with it, and I noticed that I was just jinxed.  I couldn't hit it worth a damn.  I was
getting frustrated, and that meant it would probably hit me sooner or later.  Probably
sooner.  I started retreating in leaps and bounds, still shooting, hoping to get a good shot
or two in.
<p>
As I fell back, I noticed something.  The Scorpitron had advanced during our fight, trying
to get a clear shot.  It had moved down the street about two buildings, and one of the
buildings it faced looked familiar.  I cursed as I retreated out of the Scorpitron's range
of fire.   That building had been described to me by my SourceGroup logistics agent.  I
could hear him now.
<p>
"In pre-Wasteland days, this building was tenanted by a rare and exotic arms dealer.  I
know most everywhere has been looted, but you might check anyway while you're there.
Some rare and exotic arms don't exactly look like they are.  You might get lucky."
<p>
Of all the places to put a Scorpitron!
<p>
I knew that I could get in, though.  I don't know any killer robot that can't be taken out by
a properly skilled fighter in Johnson Servotech power armor.  It's just a fact of life.
I suppose I'm overly proud, because I'm Johnson too.  Johnson Servotech was my Granpa.
I'd have brought my hovertank in to do the job, but I'd have attracted too much attention,
and I didn't want a lot of questions.  As soon I settled whatever mystery it was that was
bothering me (and looted that building!), I was out of here.  Maloney was already dead,
and there was plenty to do in the other surviving pockets of humanity all over the country.
<p>
I beat feet back away from the Scorpitron, and I left Vegas.  I went back to the V-12
and waited. I wanted to sort some things through.  But wouldn't you know it, I fell
right asleep.
<p>
*          *          *
<p>
That night I had terrible dreams.  My granpa, who I remember as a tall man with long,
curly white hair, was chasing me through the desert.  Like all good nightmare monsters,
he would pop up out of nowhere.  It went on for about ninety minutes- that's how long dreams
usually are- and when he finally caught me, I woke up with a scream on my lips. I never
really liked my granpa.  He never actually did anything, really, but he was always scary
somehow.  And he told scary... that was it!  I pounded myself on the head for being a fool.
He always told me scary stories as a kid, and they were always about the Supreme Jerk.
I could have kicked myself.  I was so worked up because I was remembering the stupid
stories my creepy old granpa told me.
<p>
I was laughing as I assembled the inner suit for the power armor, laughing as I put on
the actual armor.  I laughed while I ran a diagnostic, laughed while I hooked the meson
cannon into the suit's nuclear battery.  In fact I laughed all the way to Vegas, shooting
everyone I saw.  No witnesses.  I saw the Jamaican barkeep, and before his first 'Jah'
I sent him spinning into a dance of death.
<p>
I laughed all the way to the Scorpitron, and I was actually beginning to wonder if maybe I
was going mad.  What was there to laugh about, really?  I got into the fray of battle,
the Scorpitron firing at me, me firing at it.  We both took some hits, my shots bouncing off
it and its shots knocking me back, but I got to my real goal.  The doorway of the old arms
building.  I was about to enter when I saw something absolutely insane.
<p>
I thought I was going crazy?  No, this fellow was purely bonkers.  He was young, late
twenties, maybe, with curly brown hair and no armor, just a coverall.  He was running
forward, right into the Scorpitron's way.  It was only when he did a very strange thing
that I noticed something was just a little more out of the ordinary than I thought.  He
was armed with a hand mirror.
<p>
Confidently running forward, the man began flashing beams of the bright morning sun from the
mirror at the Scorpitron.  And it worked!  The Scorpitron wasn't aiming right, and its
tail was even pointing backwards.  This guy was luckier than Ace!  Then he did something
that showed it wasn't luck.  He did something I couldn't even do.  He did a standing high
jump all the way up to the Scorpitron's head.  I had powerful muscles and reflexes, from
nerve accelerators at SourceGroup and, more importantly, experience.  But this guy moved
like a flash.  He was on the Scorpitron's head, tearing away at wires and actuation clusters
with his bare hands.  Nobody could do something like that but the Supr- I cut myself off
before I thought that stupid name.  I caught myself again, to think 'But who else could
do it?'
<p>
I barely got my thought together before the Scorpitron exploded.
<p>
*          *          *
<p>
I woke up in darkness.  The power armor had failed, and I didn't have helmet sensors, but
more importantly I didn't have power from the suit to lift the beam and rubble that pinned me.
I thought about what had happened.  The Scorpitron exploding must have knocked me inside
the building, which then collapsed onto me and knocked me down into the basement.  Great.
<p>
After a moment my eyes adjusted, and there was a trickle of light from the rubble.  I noticed
a glint to my right.  Turning my head to the right as far as it would go, I saw it.  The
Proton Axe.
<p>
It was just that; an axe.  But it was also an energy weapon, and considered one of the most
sophisticated technologies developed before WW3.  I t would cut through anything.  And it
was only two feet away.  I reached, but the joints of the suit, frozen without power, stopped
the motion of my arm.  I couldn't reach it.  I would have screamed, but I heard my name
called.
<p>
"Sonny, sonny, wake up goshdarnit it!"  It was the weird, gravelly voice of my grandfather.  I
didn't even bother to look, because I was sure that I was hallucinating.  When the voice
was followed by a kick to my helmet that shook the whole suit,  I looked.
<p>
It was the man who attacked the Scorpitron.  I could see him just barely in the low light.
I hadn't recognized the hair before, because it was long, curly, and brown.  Like mine.
Not white.  The man was tall and strong, vital and full of energy.   Not old and bent.
But it was my grandfather all right.  The eyes were the same, and the voice.
<p>
"Let me out, granpa.  I'm trapped."  I didn't care if my granpa was a ghost.  I wanted out.
<p>
"Hell no, Sonny.  I didn't raise no weak sons, and neither did my sons. You gotta do it
yourself."
<p>
"What's going on, granpa?"
<p>
"Well, Sonny."  He knelt in front of my helmet so I could hear better.  "I hope you didn't
think that your little sourcegroup was the last word on things.  There are some agendas
that are hidden but still being carried out.  And I'm keeping track of them.  Why just
last year your dad got out of hand, and I had to snuff him and destroy his clone program."
<p>
"Bastard."  It was all I had strength to say.
<p>
"Heh.  Well, I bet you wonder why your old granpa is still around.  I betcha thought that
all those I stories I told you were make-believe.  Well, they were reminiscence, not
fairytales!"  He laughed and I moaned.  "Well, I'm still alive because of beatiful,
beautiful clone technology.  One body wears out, make a new one.  And so on.  So I can
just keep going, doing the things I do."  He gestured around him.  "The Wasteland is
a bit of a handicap, mind you, but I always loved a challenge."
<p>
"Why..."
<p>
"Don't be melodramatic, Sonny.  You're pinned under several tons of rubble.  It doesn't
work.  Tell you what.
<p>
I'll give you a chance at the family business if you meet me somewhere.  How about... the
West Coast.  The southern tip of Highway 101, right before it drops off to where California
was.  I'll meet you there in a week."  He pondered a moment.  "No, make that two days.
Latimer Johnson never raised no weak grandsons."
<p>
"Latimer?" I croaked.
<p>
He rose and nudged the Proton Axe closer to my arm with his foot.  Then he was gone.
<p>
"Two days, Sonny.  And don't even think about snuffing me the way I did your dad.
<p>
"You may be Photon Stud, but you're no Supreme Jerk."
