<P>Chapter 1 - Departures

<P>&nbsp;
<P>The first thing that Jerrek noticed was the smell. It was the smell of decay and 
death. Just over the hill was his hometown, if you could even call it a town. 
Just a meager grouping of shanties and only one real building, which was where 
the doctor, James, practiced his trade. It might just be a heap of garbage to 
passerby, but to him it was home.

<P>Scavenging didn't go so well that day, and all he had to show for a whole day's 
worth of searching was a few bottlecaps. He shook his head and continued his 
trek up the hill. What is that damned smell? It seemed to be getting stronger by 
the moment. Probably just a dead brahmin or something.

<P>He was beginning to become a bit bothered by the smell, and the thoughts that it 
provoked weren't pleasant ones. They wouldn't just leave a dead brahma out to 
rot this close...His feet picked up the pace until he was jogging up the hill.

<P>Finally cresting the hill, he stopped to catch his breath, realizing that he'd 
been running up the hill. After sucking in a few large breaths of sick-smelling 
air, he looked across the small valley.

<P>Tendrils of smoke rose lazily from the mass of burnt buildings that used to be 
his home. The sickening smell hit him full force and he staggered to his knees. 
His home. His family. He gagged on the smell, and almost emptied the contents of 
his stomach right there. He fought to keep his stomach under control. The 
knotting and clenching in his gut finally ceased.

<P>Before he knew it, he was on his feet and running as fast as he could down the 
hill, towards the smoke. In his haste he stumbled and fell, skidding down the 
last ten feet of the hill. He barely noticed.

<P>He pulled himself up again and continued into the mass of burnt shanties, no 
more left than scorched husks of metal and bits of fabric. The smell was 
unbearable this close. He now saw the burnt skeletal remains of the townspeople, 
some in the street; some buried under piles of burnt rubble. 

<P>His eyes began to burn from the smoky haze that filled the air, and he wiped 
vigorously at them with his hand. He searched desperately for anybody, anything 
that was still alive. He began to walk towards the center of the town, and 
towards his home.

<P>Suddenly, something moved a bit off, partially behind one of the less ravaged 
huts. Legs. He ran in that direction.

<P>As he rounded the burnt shanty, he saw whose legs they were. Joseph! He knelt by 
his friend's side, trying to find any trace of injury.

<P>There was no injury to be found, although there was blood caked on the sides of 
Joseph's mouth.

<P>"Joe!" Jerrek shouted, gently shaking him. "Joe, are you okay?"

<P>Joseph stirred slightly and let out a moan, lifting a hand shakily to his 
forehead to block out the sun. "Jar?" He asked in a weak voice, squinting 
through the haze.

<P>"It's me." Jerrek said, nodding his head slightly. "Joe, where are you hurt?

<P>Joseph grimaced, letting out a grunt of pain. "Jer? I'm glad you're okay. 
Take... Take care of 'Lyssa for me, okay?" With that, his eyes began to glaze 
over, and he drew a shallow breath before saying, "I know you will."

<P>Jerrek sat watching as his friend's chest rose and fell for the last time. 
Quietly he closed Joseph's eyes. He sat there for a moment, stunned. Joe, who 
had been his friend longer than he could remember, was dead.

<P>He rolled Joseph's body over slightly, looking for any sign of injury. He 
quickly found it, a large piece of jagged metal protruding from his back, just 
to the right of his spine, which had probably pierced his lung. It looked like a 
chunk of the sheet metal used in some of the huts. What the hell happened here?

<P>He gently laid the cooling body down and stood on slightly shaky legs. He'd 
adapted to the smell a bit, but still felt like he was going to vomit at any 
moment. Suddenly something occurred to him, something that Joseph said.

<P>"Alyssa? Alyssa! Can you hear me? Where are you?"

<P>His voice carried out across the town, brining no reply. He closed his eyes and 
steeled himself against anything he might see along the way, and started 
walking, picking his way along through the rubble.

<P>Along the way he saw bodies, most of them burnt beyond recognition. Some were 
just charred skeletons, but others he recognized. He tried to focus on searching 
for the living, and ignoring the dead.

<P>He searched, but found nothing but burnt bodies and collapsed huts. Soon he was 
coming upon the one hut that he dreaded reaching. His family's home. It was 
burnt down completely, only the metal supports remaining standing.

<P>He considered searching through the rubble, but decided not to, knowing what 
he'd find underneath. A cold sense of calm crept slowly over him. He turned and 
walked toward the wreckage of the doctor's house. I'll mourn the dead later, but 
now I must survive.

<P>The stone and plaster house was scorched, but not quite as burnable as the huts, 
so it was more-or-less standing, although the wooden roof had burnt to a crisp 
and collapsed underneath it's own weight.

<P>Searching through the rubble, Jarrek found what he was looking for. A metal 
footlocker with a rusty old lock on it. James had shown him it a few weeks ago. 
It was full of survival gear and other things that must be useful. He broke the 
lock with a few strikes from a chunk of the wall and opened the aluminum box.

<P>An old hiking backpack was the first thing he removed, giving it a quick 
inspection. The fabric was a bit tattered in a few places, and the metal frame 
was a bit dented, but it looked to be perfectly useable. Inside were at least a 
week's worth of dried food, two canteens full of water and a box of 24 shotgun 
shells. Tucked into the side pocket were a stimpack and a few bandages.

<P>Setting that aside, he rummaged through the rest of the contents of the box. A 
large hunting knife, about 20 bottlecaps, a box of matches and a flashlight were 
the only things of use he could find. Unfortunately, there was no shotgun to be 
found. Damn, just my luck! Plenty of shells, but nothing to use them with.

<P>He swung the lid shut and sat down on a piece of rubble, going through the 
contents of his backpack one last time. Abruptly, he felt the chunk of plaster 
and stone shift to the side and roll over. Jarrek ended up lying in the ground.

<P>He began to stand up and then froze. In front of him was the crushed body of the 
village's doctor, James.

<P>The roof's collapse had taken their toll on the body, and all of his limbs were 
bent at sickening angles. His head was nothing more than a mass of bone and 
brain fragments, crushed by a large chunk of stone.

<P>He quickly moved away from the grisly sight, his stomach twisting. With 
considerable effort, he managed to get it to stay still. About to turn away and 
leave, he noticed a suspicious looking metal tube sticking out from beneath the 
body. 

<P>Approaching the body slowly, he got a closer look. Clutched in his hands, almost 
as if he were protecting it from the fallen rubble, was his shotgun.

<P>Jarrek felt a surge of hope fill him. Perhaps he would stand a chance against 
the huge geckoes that roamed the wasteland outside of confines of the town. He 
grasped the barrel of the shotgun with both hands, and after a good bit of 
pulling and struggling he managed to pull it free. He examined the shotgun more 
closely.

<P>It was in good condition, it's wooden grip scraped up a bit, but still intact. 
James had shown him how to load, clean, and shoot it once. It seemed to be okay. 

<P>He slung the shotgun over one shoulder using its shoulder strap and the backpack 
over the other. Silently he thanked James, and picked his way out of the 
building and out into the street. 

<P>It was getting late, and the sun was nearly touching the tops of the mountains 
in the distance. He walked to the edge of the town and took a long look back.

<P>He always planned to leave, but not like this. He bid a silent farewell to the 
only home he had ever known, and walked steadily towards the sinking sun, and 
hopefully towards safety.
