<p><h2>Segment 1</h2>
<p><h3>by Timo Takalo</h3>

The sun was just setting as a lone figure walked towards the door. Next to the
door was an old, weathered sign saying "Crowley's Occult Shop".
The man reached the door and opened it carefully. A small bell rang as the
door opened. The shop was quite clean, but it was evident that nothing had
happened there for a long time. It was like stepping into a completely sealed
crypt, where nothing had changed for centuries. Except that the air wasn't
stale. Even the old man sitting sleeping behind the counter was almost like a
corpse. But he was alive, all right. He just had slept a long time.
<p>
The man walked slowly through the room towards the counter, looking at shelves
filled with arcane artifacts. Incense. Tarot cards. Even a crystal ball.
But none of the really powerful stuff was on display.
<p>
Finally the man reached the counter and looked at the propertior,
Crowley sleeping behind the counter.
<p>
"Dammit Crowley, don't you do anything but dream these days?"
<p>
No answer. The man pulled a small pouch from under his trenchcoat,
opened it and took some glittering dust from the pouch. Then he put the dust
on his palm, lowered his hand and face to Crowley's and blew the dust to his
face.
<p>
Crowley started to cough and woke up. "What the hell!? Who was that! Damn,
my back feels stiff. How long have I been sleeping?"
<p>
"At least weeks, it seems. You should spend more time in the real world,
maybe even work out a bit."
<p>
"Oh, hi Tim. Yeah, I know that. I just kinda forget myself in there.
You know what it is like."
<p>
"Yep. By the way, how was ol' Morpheus?"
<p>
"Just fine the last time I saw him. But what are you doing here?"
<p>
"Just thought I'd stop by and say hello. And maybe see if you had any useful
stuff."
<p>
"Yeah, I might have some. But let's go get a beer first, shall we?"
<p>
"Fine by me. Just don't ask me to touch any Snake Squeezins. There's a bar
just on the other side to the street."
<p>
"Really, last time I saw it it was being held by some gang."
<p>
"Well, some rangers cleared it out lately. Then somebody decided to use the
building for something profitable. You know there isn't a good bar in Needles."
<p>
"Yeah. OK, let's go."
<p>
Crowley opened the counter and started walking towards the door with Tim.
After they were out, Crowley locked the door and they both crossed the street.
The bar was full of life and people from the wasteland.
