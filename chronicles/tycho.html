	Trolling down a Capitol freeway littered with abandoned Corvegas and other fusion-drive junk heaps. Somebody starts firing at me. Spinning around, trying to locate the muzzle flashes. Left leg is hit; I'm hobbling.
	</p><p>
	There he is. Raider with a mohawk and hunting rifle. I let loose with a single shotgun shell and the whole place goes nuclear. Maybe I got him outright, but I definitely got the car behind him, given that it explodes. Half-dozen nearby cars follow suit. Dude is surely toast.
	</p><p>
	Vision going white. Limping outta the inferno. Heart beating in my mouth.
	</p><p>
	Note to self: avoid the freeways. It may be a wasteland, but D.C. still has killer traffic.
	</p>

    <div class="section" id="sect_seg2">Entry 2</div>
	<p>
	Anchorage War Memorial, listening to Three Dog on Galaxy News Radio. "Don't feed the Yao Guai." What the frak is a Yao Guai? Above ground is a giant monument of three soldiers from that mother of all WW3 battles; below is an infested, irradiated, flooded maze of mirelurk nests, humming machinery, settler hovels, and caves.
	</p><p>
	Frakkin' caves.
	</p><p>
	Last door of the pumping station (or whatever) below ground leads to some admin offices, and a hole in the floor to some bonafide caves---flowstone, stalactites, the works. Pretty impressive stuff I guess, if you like rocks. I don't. Following mirelurk noises. Deep water ahead, clicking as usual. Donning radiation suit, popping Rad-X. Damn, it's cold down here. Suddenly, ahead is the biggest-ass mirelurk EVAR. PipBoy HUD declares it their King. In Vault-Tec We Trust? Whatever. I pump three shells at 'im, but hardly scratch his carapace.
	</p><p>
	Faster than you can say, "Why don't you do your own frakkin' research, Moira?" Mr. King and his crusty mate are after me. Run away! More like wade away. Crikey, how do they move so fast? Solid ground finally, running backwards, sprinkling my tracks with bottlecap mines. One explosion. Two. Three. Frak, last one was close---my head rings. My vision blurs. Low on shells. Whipping out Chinese assault rifle. Injecting stims. King's down but his mate is fairly pissed. Queenie rips into me. V.A.T.S. gets a good reading on her tiny triangular face. One burst, two's all I'll get. The mirelurk hits! The mirelurk hits! The mirelurk explodes in a cloud of crab boil! The bite-covered mirelurk rises from the dead! OK, not that last one.
	</p>

    <div class="section" id="sect_seg3">Entry 3</div>
	<p>
	Heading to Rivet City. Sign says holster your weapons or you'll be shot. Done. Facade of some kind of fancy hotel. Opening the door to what passes for a mobster's paradise these days. Enter Dukat, Russian crime boss and sharpshooter, or so his girls say. The sultry redhead, Cherry, wants out and would I mind escorting her to Rivet City? Sure. Dukat may be good with a gun, but he's also too drunk to care. Everywhere I turn, sounds of gulping. The other girl's a lush too.
	</p><p>
	Leaving the place, Cherry in tow, in her nightie. Yeah, didn't see that coming. Three Dog's spinning that Bob Crosby track again on GNR: "the owls are the hootiest." Every time I crouch, Cherry crouches. Simon says stand up! She stands. Simon says run! She runs. Creep! She creeps. Didn't say Simon! Yer busted! "Guilty as charged."
	</p><p>
	Supermutants in a wrecked building ahead. "This is hopeless!" Cherry yells from behind, making me jump. "Oh no!" she shouts again. About to turn around and tell her to shut the frak up when Supermutie #1 starts taking potshots from the second floor. #2 on the ground revs up his mini, walks it forward.
	</p><p>
	Caught like a molerat in arclights, staring into that minigun on full auto, mesmerized by white-hot lead flying past like Star Wars frakkin' hyperspace. Snapping out of it. Ow! Argh! Frak!! Cherry's hit too, a graze. Run away! Avoid the ditch! Zing! Zing! OK, don't; that's what Rad-Away's for. Damn vault-Tec training. Splashing through ditch, I duck behind a ruined support column. Turning around, shushing Cherry. Hoping she doesn't give our position away. Noticing her switchblade out. Now where the frak did she hide that thing? Telling her to stay put; this is how One-Oh-One handles things....
	</p><p>
	OK, so it wasn't pretty. But as my G.O.A.T. instructor remarked, at least I get the job done. After blowing up #2's minigun (and him along with it), I tossed frag grenades at #1. The last concussion launched #1 off his perch and onto the ground below. All your loot are belong to me.
	</p><p>
	Back to Cherry. Let's go.
	</p><p>
	"Glad <em>that's</em> over with."
	</p><p>
	No thanks from Little Miss Sarcasm. Wasteland's like that, sucking the niceties outta you.
	</p>

    <div class="section" id="sect_seg4">Entry 4</div>
	<p>
	Dawn breaks on Rivet City. 
	</p><p>
	It's been a long way on foot from Megaton, braving supermutants, centaurs, radroaches, ghouls and raiders. Had to park Cherry at a safe house on account of her mouth going off. On my return, she threatened to set out back to Dukat's on her own if we didn't get a move on. Pushy, pushy. Now that we're here, all I get is more sarcasm: "Yeah, yeah, you're my hero. Don't let it go to your head."
	</p><p>
	So Moira wants the scoop on the floating city. Not a prob. It's a real frakkin' aircraft carrier. They even got religion here, but not like those Children of the Atom whack jobs. There's a marriage, which I kind of cause by obtaining some pheromones for a horny waitress. Only I didn't realize the target of her affections is an acolyte. Or was. Dude's honorable to a fault. Good news is everyone likes a wedding, except maybe the guy who was roped into it. And the priest who lost his protege. Oh well, life's short and all that.
	</p><p>
	Sitting in pews at the wedding. Nothing better to do. Priest sermonizing. Yadda yadda, "I do" and then Cherry walks in the church and parks herself next to the imminent bride! Suddenly things are getting interesting. Half expecting Cherry to break things up not-so-gently. Weddings are kind of like pre-war car races: some people attend just to see the crash and burn. I swear you could hear a grenade pin drop. But alas, Cherry eventually wanders back out. She's not exactly running on full thrusters, Jim. I can just hear Amata saying that....
	</p><p>
	A few grumpy scientists holed up in here, only one of them mad. Or two. Dr. Zimmerman says he's looking for an android. Okaaaaay. Dr. Li plays with food. Dr. Pinkerton just tinkers and spends his days hating Dr. Li's guts from the broken flooded bow of the carrier, surrounded by mirelurks that he keeps at bay with booby traps. Nearly lose my frakkin' arm snooping around down there. Probably be glowing for weeks what with all the swimming. OK, had enough fun. Calling it a day.
	</p>

    <div class="section" id="sect_seg5">Entry 5</div>
	<p>
	Hearing shots as I climb out of Franklin Metro. Hello, Talon fan club. If I ever find out who put a price on my head.... Ducking back down the stairs to reload and there's the whine of a minigun revving up. And that would be supermutants. This day is really starting to suck rocks.
	</p><p>
	But hang on, they're fighting each other! I stay out of sight. Yeah, yeah, the enemy of my enemy and all that crap. Wasteland don't play by those rules. Dust is settling, so I crawl back out and finish off the last mutie before he cracks open a Merc Ready to Eat. I need that combat armor. No hard feelings, Talon. It's wasteland rules.
	</p><p>
	Across the debris-crusted street lies Hubris Comics. Sure, why not. Moira's "research" can wait. Down a hallway. Click! Getting pelted with rapid-fire thingies! Grenades? Holy Frak! Run away! I scramble back around the corner. But there's no explosion. Heart pounding. WTF?! Tripwire-activated batting machine. Baseballs. Deep breath. Smooth, Tycho. Real smooth.
	</p>

	Gold Ribbon Grocery. Hoping they have Salisbury Steak.
	</p><p>
	Opening the door onto a small shelf-inhabited space. Hand-painted arrows mark a pressure plate on the floor? And there's the pitching machine. Yeah, right. Shopkeeper must be a perfectionist: Abraxo and detergent boxes stand in an orderly line, drawing the eye down to the far end of the shelf where there's a Brahmin skull-capped battering ram hanging by chains, poised to strike. And what's that smell? Frak, gas. Leaky generator. Ah geeze, more pressure plates, a grenade tourniquet, precariously perched fire extinguishers. Don't touch, Ethel!
	</p><p>
	Amata showed me something like this before: a Rube Goldberg setup. What's a Rube? What's a Goldberg? Hell if I know, but I'm gonna keep investigating. WITH MY EYES. Touching anything is out of the question until then.
	</p><p>
	Oops.
	</p><p>
	Brushed against something. The skull swooshes overhead, parts my hair and barely nicks the closest box, which of course starts a domino chain reaction. Mesmerized by the perfect precision, holding my breath. The last box of Abraxo falls on a pressure plate.
	</p><p>
	This can't be good.
	</p><p>
	Backing into a corner by the dangling ram. The pitching machine whirls into action. Baseballs flying. One hits the balanced fire extinguisher, which topples onto a second pressure plate, which pulls the pins from the grenades, which drop, explode, burst two other fire extinguishers. The leaked gas ignites, a hot, billowing, angry conflagration racing with monster truck force all the way back to its source.
	</p><p>
	The generator explodes! Shrapnel flies! Electricity arcs! The building heaves! The building hulches! Wizard needs food badly!
	</p><p>
	Ears ringing. Dust settling. A metallic sliding sound. Whipping my shotgun around. Something is definitely scraping against metal. Getting louder. I look up. Overhead, a trap door reveals a chute. Manna from heaven. Books! Ammo! Missiles! A mini-nuke!?
	</p><p>
	All this, and no Salisbury Steak. Frak.
	</p>

    <div class="section" id="sect_seg8">Entry 8</div>
	<p>
	Another vault! Strangely, 106 is unlocked. The giant gear-door rolls away to reveal a tetanus farm. Ugh, the smell. Decrepit and abandoned. Wait---voices.
	</p><p>
	"Who's there?" they yell. "Where?" yell they.
	</p><p>
	Layout is like 101, though lots of cave-ins. Someone ahead with a vault suit, spiked hairdo and a lead pipe, which he swings clumsily. Rat-a-tat-tat, he's down on the mat. Raiders? Crikey. Maybe I should close the entrance, but I decide to loot Mr. Mohawk instead. My omniscient PipBoy catalogs the guy as "Insane Survivor." Hmm. Fifty percent accurate.
	</p><p>
	I relieve a few more Insane Survivors of that burdensome title before they can bash my head in. Bits of paper here and there with odd hippie scribblings about seeing blue and feeling groovy. Hacking a security terminal that lays it bare: the Vault was gassed with a hallucinogen. What the frak? Why? Seems like I read about Vault-Tec experimenting like this elsewhere. Bastards. I gotta get out of this death trap.
	</p><p>
	Rounding the corner, my vision turns all shades of blue. I'm in a Miles Davis album. There's my father, beckoning to me. DAD!? I race to meet him, but he's gone. Instead, I'm in a pristine computer lab, with working terminals, a mainframe. Locked out of the mainframe, but the terminals hold messages for me. FOR. ME. They say, relax dude, embrace the blue, enjoy it. Frak off, toaster. Whacking a terminal screen. Predictably, it says it has nothing more to say to me. Fine. My vision clears. The terminals around me are now rusty heaps, the mainframe's Hal-9000 eye, dark.
	</p><p>
	I reach the two-story commons area, where the Overseer's office should be... overseeing things. Yep, there it is. Gotta get up there. More crazies get in the way. More flashes of blue, becoming more frequent now. In the blue, everything is clean, nice. Out of the blue, it's trashed up. I reach the dorms. One family's skeletons lie where their owners last slept. A note they slipped under their formerly locked door instructs the outside reader to use a password to gain entrance, because people affected by the gas can't read. I guess nobody came.
	</p><p>
	Finally, the Overseer's office. Stepping through the door into the blue. There's the Overseer. He's a friendly on the Pip-dar. Great, maybe he has answers. I run up to him, but he vanishes with the blue into the rust. Bugger. Place is really pissing me off. Hacking his terminal reveals his plans to deploy the gas, and for any contingency. Great, another whack job Overseer. Vault-Tec sure knew how to pick 'em. There's no secret tunnel underneath his desk, like my vault. I'm outta here.
	</p><p>
	OK, one last door on the way out: Science Labs. Inside, it gets blue again. A lab-coated fem attacks me. My all-knowing PipBoy identifies her as simply "Survivor". So I disarm and let her take a few swings. But she doesn't stand down. Ow. Ow. OW! OK, fine, break's over. I fire a burst, and she disappears. What the frak? More voices. There's a guy in a gang jacket. Butch! Vault 101 Butch, and two of his Tunnel Snakes! They're attacking! Guys! Stop! They take a few swings, then they're gone.
	</p><p>
	Frak, I really am going crazy. It's the gas, I'm just hallucinating. But then why the frak am I bleeding? Suddenly, fem lab-techie reappears, only kind-of: she's using a StealthBoy, so all I see is her displacement field. And she's one tough cookie. Reload, rip, run, repeat. She goes down. The blue fades to brown. In the back, there's a blast door opening up to a cave housing several skeletons and a minor arsenal. Looks like a few vault dwellers locked themselves out of the madness and tried to dig their way out. They failed.
	</p><p>
	I've had it with this hellhole. Racing back to the front entrance, I realize there's no exit keypad. Had the vault door closed, I would have sealed my fate. No wonder they went insane. They were buried alive. I suddenly miss Amata.
	</p><p>
	As the rusty gate opens up to the outside, I welcome the bleak grayscape that is my home, breathe in the burnt wind of a long-dead civilization, and don't look back.
	</p>

    <div class="section" id="sect_seg9">Entry 9</div>
	<p>
	Subway diving. Following signs for the Brotherhood of Steel. Eventually it's gonna come down to them, I just know it. They're the real power brokers in the Capitol wasteland.
	</p><p>
	Opening door into an underground parking garage. Vehicles rusting away the years. Dogmeat---autorecorder, meet my new scrapyard mutt! Dogmeat's growling as we thread our way between the junked cars. Tracking several blips on Pipdar. A couple of flat-footed ghouls charge. I miss, and the garage explodes violently. (Note to self: never, ever use a shotgun when surrounded by nuclear power cores.) Car doors and hoods flying by. I duck pathetically, and cook in the radiation bath. A worm-eaten survivor gets a shot sandwich. Checking wounds with a grimace. Miraculously, Dogmeat is unscathed. Popping RadAway, shooting stims. A door on the far side of the garage rests in a crumpled heap, blown off its hinges.
	</p><p>
	Emerging from the subway onto the National Mall. Smithsonian central. Walking over to a ghoul fem standing sentinel outside the National Museum. Name's Willow. Says she's guarding the entrance to the Underworld. So <em>this</em> is where they're holed up. "You can't miss, tourist. It's under the big skull." Natch.
	</p><p>
	Sure enough, it's right there in the rotunda, opposite a jumbled heap of Tyrannosaur bones. So, the Underworld. That's one big frakkin' skull. Pass. Ghouls still make my skin crawl.
	</p><p>
	Instead, I head into the Lincoln special exhibit. Lots of books, lots of Lincoln paraphernalia, including that picture of the Memorial that Caleb at the Temple of the Union requested. Rolling it up and stowing it. The stacks are crawling with supermutants, but it's easy to get the drop on them with so many places to hide. Collecting Lincoln artifacts. Hannibal will pay good caps for this crap: Lincoln's top hat, his voice on a wax cylinder, some pennies, etc. I even scored the dead Pres' lever-action breech-loaded .45 rifle. Hundreds of years old, and this puppy's aim is still true. They sure don't make 'em like they used to.
	</p><p>
	Stopping by the Memorial on the way out---a request from Caleb's fellow revolutionary, Hannibal. A bunch of slavers have knocked Lincoln's oversized block off and driven out the supermutants that Caleb feared were here. I talk to the slavers' leader, a pompous git who's name I immediately forget, and I don't care. Lincoln is big throughout the wasteland, a hero to slaves, and his memory is cause for so much angst among the scumbags that they preemptively desecrated and occupied the Memorial to prevent it from unifying the slaves into outright rebellion. The slavers will pay top dollar for Lincoln artifacts too---to destroy them. These scabs even want me to double-cross Hannibal. Sure, I lie through my teeth. But they've got another think coming. And I've got just the plan for that.
	</p><p>
	Heading back to the Temple of the Union. Find Caleb on guard duty. One Lincoln Memorial poster, as per request. His eyes light up like a Yao Guai caught in a nuka grenade burst. Lincoln is everything to these former slaves. It is just the inspiration Caleb needs. We find Hannibal up in the crumbling shell of the pre-war office building that serves as the Temple, and he rounds up the rest, and starts heading toward the Capitol. Hold your horses, man. You're carryin' the fire, but you sure as hell ain't packin' the heat. I offer to scout ahead to Prepare Ye The Way. Hannibal gives me one hour, then he's going in with his posse to clear out the joint with or without me.
	</p><p>
	Scouting ahead, arriving at dusk. No slavers. It's eerily quiet on the steps. A long shadow of a once-stately fluted column crosses Lincoln's decapitated head. Taking a moment to read his words, carved into a wall, larger than life, just like his statue. "Government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth." My eyes drift from the marble to the devastated Capitol Mall, the irradiated reflecting pool, the pockmarked Washington Monument. Sorry, pal, but the government looks pretty much perished from here.
	</p><p>
	Sweeping around the ruined memorial, finding nothing but a few grenade tourniquets and mines. All clear. One last check of the maintenance room, and it's back to Hannibal with the good news. If only. Slavers storm out of the room as I approach, guns blazing. Spinning, ducking around a corner, seeing red. Hauling up the memorial steps for better cover among the fallen columns. Taking them out one by one with the help of Lincoln's deadly accurate repeater. Fitting.
	</p><p>
	Silence. Thought for sure there was one more. Warily heading back to the subway station where I find Hannibal's gang. I did what I could. Hannibal nods gravely, says he'll lead the charge, brandishing his hunting rifle as if he were rearing up on horseback. Sighing, I follow the ragtag band back to the memorial and up the steps. Everyone's milling about, wondering if they've won, if their journey is at an end. Suddenly shots ring out and one of the former slave girls goes down---the unfriendly one. Sniper. Crouching, I whirl about, but the acoustics and shadows in the memorial work against me. Another shot, a miss. I've got you now, you bastard. Drop him with a .45 slug courtesy the 16th President.
	</p><p>
	Caleb walks over to me, offers a hand, beaming. He's gonna put Lincoln's head back where it belongs. "Today is a day to remember."
	</p><p>
	It's just like all the others, friend.
	</p>

    <div class="section" id="sect_seg10">Entry 10</div>
	<p>
	National Archives. Here on a long-standing request from Abe Washington, curator of Rivet City's Capitol Preservation Society museum, for some historical papers to add to his eclectic collection of Americana. First Lincoln, now this. The things I go through for history nut-jobs. Trying the back door, which leads to some empty stacks. Dogmeat whines. Not a good sign. Backing out to the main entrance out front. Entering the rotunda. Green bar on Pipdar announcing a friendly barricaded behind a rubble-strewn arena of mines. She beckons urgently for me to join her behind her sandbags. Careful, Dogmeat, those disks ain't candy.
	</p><p>
	Her name's Sydney and she's a treasure hunter, though she uses a fancier term for it. Whatever. She'd been delving the Archives for a while when she discovered a secret cargo elevator in the center of the rotunda. She's hacked into the elevator control logic and has been trying to break in for days, but the supermutants have been getting in her way. Says she has maps, and there should be plenty of goodies for both of us. Carries a custom submachine gun like she knows how to use it, like she's just another wasteland-hardened soul carving a living out of the remnants of a planet that has long given up on her.
	</p><p>
	"Heads up," she says. "Here they come."
	</p><p>
	And so they do. Bellowing and growling, three waves of supermutants rushing headlong into angry streams of screaming lead and silent mines. I concentrate on the missile launchers. Sydney mows down the ones in front who survive the concussions. Dogmeat even dives into the melee. When it's over, the carnage is among the worst I've seen, and we have escaped with only minor wounds. The stench of blood and sweat is overwhelming. Offering Sydney a stim.
	</p><p>
	Hunkered over Sydney's terminal. I find a pattern in a core dump of the cargo elevator login code and we're in. Down into the secreted artifacts of a history that has little meaning anymore. It's the right thing to do, though. If we don't preserve the past, who will remember the craptastic asswipes that got us into this mess? As much as I think Abe's got a few screws loose, I'm beginning to think he's onto something. Guess I'm my father's child, cursed with (and cursing) my conscience.
	</p><p>
	Following Sydney through the climate-controlled confines of the Archives. "Keep your eyes on the mission and off my ass, please." Crikey.
	</p><p>
	She must have a photographic memory for maps. Figures. We pilfer the Magna Carta, loot the Bill of Rights. The guard turrets are no match for my sniper rifle. (Who puts turrets in a museum?) Arriving at the bottom of the complex, a subterranean study decked out in oak-paneled, archaic decor. Meeting its sole occupant since the bombs fell: a robot in a powdered wig. Toaster thinks he's Button Gwinnett, second signer of the Declaration of Independence, our ultimate quarry. Takes some creative convincing, but he coughs it up. Abe will pay good caps for this. I even convince the would-be patriot to deactivate himself for the good of the country. Rest your tired circuits, Mr. Gwinnett.
	</p><p>
	Getting out. Aside from a battering ram that I accidentally trigger (frakking battering rams!) and a sub-basement supermutant ambush, we escape topside, then hightail it to Rivet City. Abe is ecstatic. He wants to buy Lincoln's Repeater as well, but I'm hanging on to this bad boy for the "good of the country." Splitting caps fifty-fifty with Sydney on the stairs overlooking the museum. She mentions her father in passing, that he abandoned her as a child. Something clicks, and on a hunch I bring out a letter I found in the Statesman on the way up to rescue Reilly's Rangers. Showing her. Wait for it... and bingo. It <em>is</em> from her father. Turns out he never came back from a trade gone bad. He was double-crossed and recorded his dying words. His last thoughts were of his Little Moonbeam.
	</p><p>
	And just like that, her treasure hunting days are over. Sydney crying. OK, this is awkward. Patting her back. She insists on giving me her custom SMG; she won't be needing it anymore in retirement. The implication is that I will, when I go my separate way. And yet part of me is tempted not to. Indulging a brief fantasy of what life would be like with Sydney in it. Where will you go? I ask, regretting it immediately. "The world ain't big enough for the both of us not to run into each other again." Ah, the evanescent blossom of hope.
	</p><p>
	God, I hope the wasteland doesn't quash it.
	</p>

    <div class="section" id="sect_seg11">Entry 11</div>
	<p>
	Sitting in Dad's office in the Jefferson Memorial. Dogmeat's resting on the rug, his sad heterochromic eyes looking up at me expectantly. I'm holding a plaque with Dad's favorite Bible verse, Revelation 21:6. "I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end. I will give unto him that is athirst of the fountain of the water of life freely." Beginning to think the water of life is so much Cool-Aid and Dad drank aplenty of it.
	</p><p>
	Ah, where to frakking begin. As Three Dog might say, "One-oh-one has been busy fighting the good fight," but you wouldn't know it from my log. PipBoy ran out of memory yesterday. Now recording over the last few month's worth of crap. Commencing executive summary of said crap.
	</p><p>
	After parting ways with Sydney, I revisited Dr. Li in her Science Lab. She's dour as ever, probably because oily Doc Zimmer was still hounding her about his lost android. Did some digging and learned from Doc Pinkerton in Rivet City's bow that the android had originally been programmed to hunt down fellow androids who'd escaped, but it had suffered a Pauline conversion and escaped. Pinkerton reprogrammed it with a new identity, more for the sake of the challenge than out of empathy, I suspect. Thus was born Harkness, Rivet City's security chief! Zimmer didn't know his 'droid was right under his nose! Long story short: I broke the news to Harkness using Pinkerton's command override. Harkness remembered everything, and would've hunted down Zimmer, but I offered to spare him the trouble, and he gave me his suped-up plasma rifle to do the job. (What is it with strangers giving me guns these days? Megaton townies giving me spare clips is one thing, but now this!) Dr. Li didn't appreciate the piles of molten goo, but oh well. She'd given up on James' son a long time ago.
	</p><p>
	Next, I returned to Underworld. Don't know why. Karma thing. It was time I overcame my aversion to ghouls. Karma's reward was running into Sydney again. She'd set up shop there running ammo. It was good to see her. Said she liked Underworld 'cause nobody hit on her there. Record scratch! (Ha, poor Agatha would wince!) Anyway, point taken. Another day, another dive, and we coulda been something.
	</p><p>
	I left Underworld with a ghoul in tow, my own private penance for sins past, present and future. Charon was some kind of indentured servant, owned by a sleazy ghoul bartender who wanted me to take out his competition, a harmless ghoul named Greta. Crikey, I must have merc written on my forehead. Instead, I paid Charon's debt and released him, and what does the grizzly dude do but walk over to his former boss and double tap him. With a shotgun, no less. Charon cracked me up, which is why I asked him to tag along. He was a much better shot, but he frequently felt compelled to put another round in his vics for good measure. "Wanna pizza me?" he would taunt. Dogmeat was even OK with him.
	</p><p>
	Headed to Reilly's Rangers HQ next. Reilly runs a tight ship, and she paid top caps for all the intel in my PipBoy. They were all appreciative of me rescuing her men from the top of the Statesman. Reilly even fitted me with some Ranger armor. Had a nice chat with Brick, but we mostly talked about Eugene. That frakkin' minigun even went with her to the bathroom. Good folks, all in all, and they mean well, but Reilly was sleeping with one of her subordinates, which raised a red flag. But what do I know; I grew up in a frakkin' Vault. And I left the only girl I ever frakkin' loved.... Whaddaya lookin' at, Dogmeat? Sorry, c'mere, boy. You justa good poochie.
	</p><p>
	Anyway, after Reilly's, Charon and I headed for the Capitol building grounds to see what was causing all the smoke. Amazingly enough, Congress didn't take a direct hit in the war, unlike the White House. But it had become a base of sorts for supermutants, and when we got there, Talon mercs were attacking them. Finding some high ground to scope out the action, we stumbled into a Talon sniper nest, and the dude was calling in airstrikes! The mercs have frakkin' artillery! After Charon ventilated the sniper, we had some fun shelling the kill zone and eventually cleared a path to the front steps. Inside the Capitol rotunda was a gargantuan Behemoth pulverizing some hapless Talons. Got 'im with the alien blaster. Whatever this bad boy fires, it takes a long time getting there, like shooting through water. Have to lead your target quite a bit more than usual. But there was no way I was getting that close to another Behemoth. Four hits, and he finally melted into a puddle of quarks. It took another couple hours, but we sanitized the place. Felt good.
	</p><p>
	On a tip from Reilly that there was a National Guard Armory nearby, we headed east. En route, we found yet another Behemoth taking on the Talons. Charon and I climbed atop a bus, where lo and behold, there was yet another Talon air strike call box. Only this one was broken. No problemo. I went to work, but it was tougher than I thought. "Could use a little help here," Charon growled as the Behemoth finished mopping the street with the mercs and lumbered our way. The ghoul's shotgun was useless at this range. I gave up on the call box and drained the rest of the Blaster's charge into the locomotive-sized mutant's chest. The last shot must've hurt something fierce; the Behemoth flailed backward just as it was winding up its uprooted fire hydrant. It landed with a tremendous crunch that split the pavement. Charon jumped down from the bus and casually blew off the monster's head. Goliath, meet David.
	</p><p>
	The armory delivered as promised, but we wasted as much ammo as we gained taking out the resident robot guardians. Inside there was a locked bunker that opened using the Keller family combination---a five number code I had picked up in fragmentary messages left here and there all over the Capitol wasteland. The bunker housed an experimental MIRV launcher, which accepted mini-nukes. I passed, having nearly obliterated myself launching a full-sized MIRV strike from the satellite dish way back when. (Can't remember if I mentioned that before. Oh well.) Anyway, how would you even escape the blast radius of that thing? Frakkin' launcher was too heavy anyway.
	</p><p>
	After that, we headed back to the mall, where I dropped Charon off at the Underworld. I don't know why. I think something deep inside was eating away at me. I needed some space. Didn't like what I was becoming, and Charon wasn't exactly helping. Moriarty had told me long ago in Megaton to check out the Galaxy News building, where he'd said Dad was headed after his escape from the Vault. I hated Dad for leaving me, but my anger wasn't driving me like it used to. And I began to see how selfish I'd become. So I paid a visit to Three Dog.
	</p><p>
	Galaxy News Radio is protected by Brotherhood of Steel soldiers, who waved me on in. I guess my rep precedes me. But Three Dog didn't spill the beans on Dad just yet. As much as he knew of my exploits, he didn't trust me. So he gave me a little job to do. He wanted a bigger antenna for his broadcast, and the Valiant 11 replica in the Museum of Technology had one that would do very nicely. I simply had to yank it off the lunar lander, and install it on the top of the swiss-cheese Washington Monument. Piece o' cake, right? Well, not so much. But the museum was fun. Even had a walk-through replica of a Vault, with a cheesy propaganda voice selling the pleasant life of an underground utopia. (Pleasant, my vault-kicked-out ass.) Anyway, thanks to yours truly, you can now hear Three Dog spinnin' his collection of golden oldies all over the Capitol wasteland. If you have a radio. Not that I listen much. Anyway, it was all for nothing. Three Dog knew my father---even saw him after he left Megaton---but the only lead he had for me was where Dad was going: to Rivet City to find everyone's favorite ray of sunshine. Dead end. But Dr. Li had already told me to check the Jefferson Memorial, and I hadn't, fearing what I'd find.
	</p><p>
	So here I am, sitting in Dad's office in the JeffMo basement. Knew I'd end up here eventually. Had to clear out a few supermutants who'd set up in the gift shop; otherwise, it looks like most of Dad's stuff is still here. But no Dad. These audio logs I found in his safe are staring me in the face. Debating whether to listen to them. I thought I knew my father. What if he really is a hopeless quack? What if he wasn't, but met some random end in the wasteland, like Sydney's dad? Can I survive another letdown? Can I survive not knowing?
	</p><p>
	What should I do, Dogmeat? Oh, don't gimme that look.
	</p><p>
	Ah, frak it. Frak it all.
	</p>

    <div class="section" id="sect_seg12">Entry 12</div>
	<p>
	Checking out Vault 112, the very definition of pristine, being well hidden under a random auto garage. Dad mentioned in one of his audio logs that he came here seeking out some records left by one Dr. Stanislaus Braun who worked here for Vault-Tec. Somehow, Dad got it in his head that Braun had devised a miraculous device called the G.E.C.K. that could solve all his problems. Whatever. Miracles are overrated.
	</p><p>
	Dad's nowhere to be found, but there are several vault dwellers reclining in sealed metal and glass pods here, their life support tended by tame Robobrains. One of the robots says I'm 202.3 years late, and would I please put on a vault uniform and hop into a "tranquility lounger"?
	</p><p>
	Peering inside some of the pods. Hard to see, but the occupants all look the same. Some are brain dead according to their status monitors, others are alive and "nominal". They all face a TV screen inside the pod. Looks like some pre-war scenes in black and white; a slideshow? Another Vault-Tec experiment of dubious ethics, no doubt.
	</p><p>
	Stay, Dogmeat. Opening the empty pod. Oh. You gotta press the TV screen to start. Pod sealing. OK, this is weird---
	</p><p>
	WHAT. THE. FRAK?!
	</p><p>
	So, I'm now a kid in some pre-war idyllic suburban cul-de-sac. All my loot is gone, PipBoy replaced by an analog Vault Boy watch. There are others here, adults, kids, all oblivious to the illusion, except this scary girl Betty who keeps suggesting I torment the others in exchange for answers about Dad, and Old Lady Dithers, who knows it's all a sham and blathers on about Betty being Dr. Braun, and I must find the failsafe in the abandoned house to end their suffering. Well, then.
	</p><p>
	Wallking around the place and poking around. Concluding that Vault 112 was set up as some sort of virtual world, in which its dwellers are trapped with Dr. Braun as their sadistic overlord in virtual drag. Sounds suitably twisted for Vault-Tec. If Dad is here, he could be trapped as one of these sappy brainwashed characters.... Maybe he's Dithers? Have to bust him out.
	</p><p>
	Abandoned house. Touching various trinkets around the room that make sounds when touched. Just have to find the right permutation. And.... I'm in. Hello, floating terminal. Dr. Braun's notes. So this is his "Tranquility Lane" simulation. Been playing for over a century. No wonder he's insane. Time to end this. Loading new simulation. "Chinese Invasion Failsafe" sounds promising.
	</p><p>
	Automatic gunfire outside. Cracking door open, seeing Chinese soldiers sweeping through the street firing at anything that moves. It's all over in minutes. For some reason, the soldiers don't notice me. Dithers' brains are splattered all over her sidewalk. Frak! Betty and her mangy dog are unharmed. And she is something pissed....
	</p><p>
	Betty/Braun berating me. Now <em>s/he's</em> trapped in the sim, and all the vault dwellers are dead. Really dead. I have a sinking feeling as s/he looks down. But s/he's only looking at the dog. Holy frak, Dad's the dog. Good boy, Doc!
	</p><p>
	Leaving the simulation through the virtual door. "Don't let the door slam you in the butt on the way out." See you in hell, Braun.
	</p><p>
	Dad <em>was</em> in one of the pods. I help him out. Commence awkward reunion. Yes, he's sorry, but time's of the essence. Vault 112 is a bust: Braun's a whack job, and there's no G.E.C.K. here. Now Dad wants to head to Rivet City to get Dr. Li so they can finish Project Purity. It was their life---Mom's too---and when I came along, and she died, he just gave up and gained admittance to Vault 101 in return for his doctor skills. But Dad couldn't stay away forever, and when I got old enough, he left me in the safety of the vault to pick up where he left off out in the wasteland.
	</p><p>
	Staring dumbly at Dad; it's all coming out so fast. It's alright, Dad. How easily the needle follows the groove! I catch myself making excuses for the man who always seems to be abandoning me somehow. Feeling the anger return. No, it's not alright, Dad.
	</p><p>
	I let him have it. A good, long rant. To his credit, he listens, my angry words echoing in the vast pod chamber. A Robobrain passes by us on well-oiled caterpillar tracks, its cyborg CPU apparently none the wiser of the corpses in the pods. It's even more surreal than Tranquility Lane.
	</p><p>
	Running out of breath and steam. I'm now more angry at how shrill my voice sounds, and how long it takes to quit reverberating. Then Dad disarms me: "I'm proud of you, son. Heard that you defused the bomb in Megaton." Ah frak. Talk about defusing....
	</p><p>
	[Long pause]
	</p><p>
	Hell, that was nothing, Dad. You should've seen the deathclaw sanctuary. He gives me a big long bear hug.
	</p><p>
	Let's finish what you and Mom started.
	</p><p>
	"Attaboy."
	</p>

    <div class="section" id="sect_seg13">Entry 13</div>
	<p>
	Fixing Project Purity. Actually enjoying Dad's company, though it's still tough to be in the same room with him, even after trekking with him all those miles down here. I know, I shouldn't blame the man for his dream, especially when we're this close to realizing it. His brand of unselfishness is unrecognizable, his trust so naive. He's somehow untouched by the wasteland.
	</p><p>
	Communicating with him and Dr. Li via intercom. We picked her up and her assistants at Rivet City on the way down. She's not as bitchy around Dad.
	</p><p>
	Commotion outside. I'm in a drainpipe, fixing a stuck valve. Something large eclipses the sun through a crack in the pipe. What the---vertibirds? Landing. Dad on intercom, sounding panicked. It's the Enclave. And they've got plasma rifles. Better boogie.
	</p><p>
	Back inside the JeffMo rotunda. There's TJ's statue, immersed in radioactive water inside the core housing. What a juxtaposition. Scrambling up the steps to see what Dr. Li is yelling about. Dad is inside the plexiglass-encased, sealed-off control room, along with more Enclave troops and their leader, who is apparently demanding control of Project Purity. Dad explaining it's not operational. Dr. Li's assistant Kaplinski is in there too, looking helpless. Dr. Li beating the plexiglass with her tiny fists, shouting don't do it, don't do it. I keep trying the door, even though I know it's locked from the inside.
	</p><p>
	The Enclave leader, one Colonel Autumn, pulls a gun, murders Kaplinski!
	</p><p>
	Going all cold inside. Ramming door with my shoulder. Futile. Damn the Enclave. Never trusted their eyebots, spewing President Eden's propaganda. The look on Dad's face. This isn't going to end well. Dad's back is to me; he's fiddling with the purifier's control console, "compiling the data." Compiling my ass; that's the main controller. Dr. Li screams no, James, no. Then intense light flashes inside, some consoles explode, shredding the Enclave guards. Radiation klaxons sounding. Autumn desperately fiddling with a hypo. Dad kneeling slowly, his eyes locked on my face, apologizing without words. Dr. Li screaming.
	</p><p>
	"Run, son."
	</p><p>
	I do. We round up who's left, then down a manhole. Dr. Li confirms the shit has officially hit the fan. Gee, thanks for that, Dr. Li, very helpful. I want to go back, but she yells at me, barking there's no time, and what good am I dead? Translation: would I kindly grow some balls, pull out my biggest gun and escort all our asses to safety through the sewers? Sure. Sewers it is. More Vertibirds whup-whup-whupping above.
	</p><p>
	Asking her where we're going. "The Citadel," dripping with venom. Evidently she has some favors to pull with the Brotherhood. I knew it would come back to them. Clearing out some tunnel ghouls, then impasse at a security door. Enclave troops are on top of us. Dr. Li pushing me out of the way to hack the access terminal. Fine. I'll just go shoot. Some bad guys. Or something. Sic 'em, Dogmeat.
	</p><p>
	Putting a large blast door between us and the Enclave. There's a ladder. Manhole cover. Emerging into daylight. Hello Citadel. Dr. Li strong-arms her way in, and we follow. Some kind of open-air recruit training grounds inside. Dr. Li gives the wrinkly Brotherhood leader, one Elder Lyons, a piece of her mind. It's a pretty big piece, but he's a patient geezer. Finally, "THEY KILLED JAMES!", an accusation. Dad knew the Brotherhood? Why am I always... oh frak it. Lyons says chill, we got this. Dr. Li storms off. Time to pump Gramps for info.
	</p>

    <div class="section" id="sect_seg14">Entry 14</div>
	<p>
	I am the safest frakking S.O.B. in the Capitol wasteland. Her name is Cross, and you definitely do not want to cross this Star Paladin of the Brotherhood of Steel. She carries herself with all the bearing and gravitas of the elite Lyons Pride unit, and yet she transcends even them. She carries her Super Sledge like it's a putting iron. Despite her to-a-fault cheery optimism and professionalism, she intimidates the hell outta me, and even Dogmeat avoids her. But Sarah holds her in highest regard, and Elder Lyons insisted she guide me to Vault 87 via Little Lamplight. She even claims to have known Dad.
	</p><p>
	Vault 87 is supposed to have one of Braun's G.E.C.K.s. Dr. Li confirmed it's the real deal, and that she needs it to fix Project Purity. (Naturally, the Brotherhood expected me to volunteer my sorry ass. Never gonna shake this rep.) According to Elder Lyons, the countryside around the vault took a direct hit and is still steeped in radiation. Only way in is underground, thus Little Lamplight caverns.
	</p><p>
	Heading past Megaton and the vault of my childhood. Pipboy catches an emergency broadcast. Holy crap, it's Amata! And she's asking for me?! I turn to Cross, who overhears the message and nods gravely: "I shall reflect on battles past and battles to come until your return." Whatevs.
	</p><p>
	Leaving Cross sharpening her Super Sledge (or something), I trot up the rocky path to the entrance to my home vault. Heart racing, but not from the exertion. Feeling the blood rush to my face. Classic stress symptoms; likely from the guilt of not having thought of Amata in so long. From trying to forget her.
	</p><p>
	Vault 101 has seen better days. I step over Officer Wilkins' corpse in the entrance way. Officer Gomez warns me, then rushes past to reseal the vault door. Frak, what's going on here! Further inside, Butch lets me through a barricade. Things must be going badly, as he doesn't even sucker punch me. And there she is, holed up in the clinic. Dad's clinic. She gets right to the point (nice to see you too, Amata): her father, the Overseer, doubled down after Dad and I left, and has prevented anyone else from leaving. She and some of the others are staging a coup: they want to reestablish contact with the outside world. But Security got involved, and things escalated out of hand. Somehow, she thinks I can help with the impasse. Staring at her face, memorizing it. But she's looking at me the same way the Brotherhood does when they order me to "move along, outsider."
	</p><p>
	She becomes aware of my stare, blushes. "Well, don't just stand there!" She holds her arms akimbo, radiating 'tude like an active radar array. Frak, I've missed that pout. Dogmeat walks over to her and sniffs her crotch.
	</p><p>
	I'll, uh---sorry---heel boy!---I'll deal with the Overseer. She gives me a momentarily frightened look. Talk! I'll talk to him! I'll admit, the outside has changed me, but crikey, who does she take me for? Following her gaze to Harkness' suped-up plasma rifle on my shoulder. Well, there is that. Fine. I make a big show of dumping all my lethal crap in the clinic and make my way to the Overseer's office unarmed. Tycho, Ace Problem Solver, to the rescue.
	</p><p>
	Doesn't take long to convince the Overseer to open up the vault. "How?" she splutters. Oh, I just reasoned with him that 101's genetic pool would be inviably homogeneous in a couple more generations. Now comes Butch's sucker punch, proxy for a translation request. Your dad wants to live to see his great grand kids. The Tunnel Snakes snicker. Amata blinks twice.
	</p><p>
	Then she kicks me out.
	</p><p>
	"Is everything OK in there?"
	</p><p>
	Yeah, I spit, settling my pack on my back and shouldering my plasma rifle.
	</p><p>
	"Amata?"
	</p><p>
	I guess I'm not the commitment type, I lie unconvincingly. And anyway, what the frak did Amata mean with, "You're a hero, but you have to leave"? OK, I get it: she's the new Overseer, and I'm a reminder of her father's failings, <em>my</em> father's failings. But then she tried to rationalize things by explaining that I've survived outside all this time, so exile shouldn't be that bad, right? Crikey. Who's changed now? To think I used to dream of marrying that girl.
	</p><p>
	Let's go, Dogmeat. I brush past Cross.
	</p><p>
	"Your father would be proud of---"
	</p><p>
	I said <em>let's go</em>.
	</p><p>
	[softly] "Little Lamplight is this way, Tycho."
	</p><p>
	Frakking frak it all.
	</p>

    <div class="section" id="sect_seg15">Entry 15</div>
	<p>
	The juvie settlement at Little Lamplight caverns is not exactly Lord of the Frakkin' Flies, but just as disturbing. As an adult, I'm persona non grata here, but Cross made sure I gained entrance before she departed. Guess she wasn't feeling the love. Probably for the best; surely she'd've been tempted to smack a few of the disrespecting, snot-nosed residents around. From the looks of it, most of the kids that show up here by word of mouth eventually turn into fungus-eating pissants who don't appreciate the good thing they have going. Joke's on them though, as they all get thrown out on their asses when they turn sixteen.
	</p><p>
	Not tarrying. The smartest of the lot is a refreshingly polite kid named Joseph, the town tutor of sorts. Dogmeat actually likes him. He knows about the vault access terminal deep inside the cave, and powers it up for me. Hack it, and I'm in. Later, Joe. Don't let the mayor push you around.
	</p><p>
	Vault 87. Boots clicking down the rusting, bloodstained hallways whose antiseptic undercurrent is long gone, replaced by a miasma of death not entirely removed by the wheezing air scrubbers. Hacking into scattered terminals, scarcely believing the reports of scientists' callous disregard of their human subjects. Asylum, prison and morgue, Vault 87 houses denizens that are either insane, hideously disfigured or dead, all products or byproducts of FEV, the engineered Forced Evolution Virus. Mariposa, West-Tek, Vault-Tec: the military-industrial complex as sinister triumvirate. This must be where the centaurs come from, and the supermutants. As if the bombs and killing machines weren't enough, did we really have to experiment with our own genome?
	</p><p>
	Movement in the cell ahead, a supermutant. He (they're all male, aren't they?) wants to talk, actually has a name. Fawkes seems to be the only prisoner with any marbles intact. He claims he's an experimental outlier whose intelligence never faded, despite the military eggheads' best efforts. He offers to obtain 87's G.E.C.K., housed in a deeply irradiated section of the vault, if only I bust him out. Something in his lonely, tortured voice, in his all-too familiar story, overcomes my hesitance. Maybe it's the common bond of orphans.
	</p><p>
	"Follow me," he bellows. Dogmeat and I wait outside a radiation-soaked corridor while Fawkes plods inside. The rads in there are the highest I've ever detected in the wasteland. Trying not to think how radioactive the G.E.C.K. is going to be. Eventually Fawkes returns with a briefcase. Our bargain complete, the supermutant takes his leave. Oddly enough, my PipBoy Geiger counter doesn't register increased radiation on the G.E.C.K.
	</p><p>
	Watching Fawkes trudge heavily down the corridor. Dunno about you, Dogmeat, but if I never set foot inside another vault, I'll die a happy man. Heading out the way we came. Not looking forward to running the gauntlet of those brats in Little Lampl---
	</p><p>
	[Auto-dictator v223 powering off automatically]
	</p><p>
	Shaking off the headache, grabbing my crap from the locker in the holding cell. So Raven Rock is where they've been hiding out. Gonna kill the frakkin' bastard. <em>Of course</em> the Enclave would want the G.E.C.K.: Project Purity is their ticket to control over the entire Capitol wasteland. No way I'm giving that to Autumn. Like I'd even tell him. How'd he even survive rad burst at the JeffMo? The hypo? Frakkin' murderer. Frakkin' flash grenade. What'd you do to Dogmeat? No matter. Gonna kill him. The cell door unlocks; Eden wants to see me.
	</p><p>
	[shots fired]
	</p><p>
	Well <em>that</em> was close. Crikey, Nathan, what the frak were you doing here? Of course "they're not who they say they are," crazy fool. You should have stayed in Megaton with Manya. Now I'm gonna have to tell your wife you uttered her name as you took a plasma bolt meant for me. Closing his eyes.
	</p><p>
	Heading up the stairs to the Pres. Just my luck to land at Raven Rock right in the middle of a frakkin' mutiny. Pres wants to see me, Autumn wants to shoot me. Voting with my feet.
	</p><p>
	Hello Holt, fancy finding your sour mug here. And then goodbye. She must've told the Enclave about Dad's project. About the G.E.C.K. Why, Anna? I know Dr. Li was a slave driver, but is your shiny new lab worth it? Leaving her agape. Not even worth the bullet.
	</p><p>
	So here we are. President John Frakkin' Eden. Voice of the eyebots. Somehow, I figured you to be more... <i>qu'est-ce que c'est</i>... human. You're just a big-ass ZAX mainframe.
	</p><p>
	Sooo... personnel trouble? The skin-tubes abandoning their commander-in-chip? WHAT?! Why would you want to poison the water? What have the mutants and ghouls done to you? OK, I'll grant you the feral ones, but---why yes, I know a few: Fawkes, Harold, Charon... They're just doing their best with the rotten hand they've been dealt.... 
	</p><p>
	[President Eden's synthetic voice is too garbled to transcribe]
	</p><p>
	Well, that's a surprise. I had pegged Autumn as a murderous megalomaniac. How quaint that he disagrees with you. I'm---OK, OK, I'll grab your poison pill already. But listen to me...
	</p><p>
	I'm having a hard time seeing how your programming could lead you to conclude that you can reset things by pumping this FEV through Project Purity. I'll admit starting over has a certain attractiveness. But THERE ARE NO PURE STRAINS LEFT! The vaults are all cracked open.
	</p><p>
	No, I <em>wasn't</em> born in a vault. Cross confirmed that. What? Her? Oh, she's just a---nevermind her. My point is, I'll die---we'll <em>all</em> die. This canister won't cleanse the wasteland, it will destroy it. Don't you see the error in your internal logic?
	</p><p>
	Yep, blame it on the code monkeys. Definitely a bug. A nasty one. Probably been there forever. Who knows what other subroutines it affects. Yeah. Systemic.
	</p><p>
	Oh, wow, well, that's uh, quite presidential of you... sir. Just uh, wait until I get the frak out of here before you nuke the place. Yeah. It's uh, been an honor... Mr. President? Bye now. Remember to wait!
	</p><p>
	Whack job.
	</p><p>
	Out of Raven Rock into the Capitol wasteland. Fawkes?! Fancy seeing you here. The Enclave nabbed me in your vault, but I escaped. Seen my dog?
	</p><p>
	[huge explosion]
	</p><p>
	HOLY SHIT!!! You OK? FAWKES?
	</p><p>
	"There are times that I feel the primal part of me pulling me away."
	</p><p>
	Keep it together, man. What the---shoot it! Shoot it!
	</p><p>
	[vertibirds screaming overhead, muffled explosions continue]
	</p><p>
	Dammit. That would be Autumn. Killed my father. Stole my G.E.C.K. The one you retrieved.
	</p><p>
	So, uh, if you don't have anywhere else to go, I know some folks who could really use your help. They were going to use that G.E.C.K. to fix a big-ass water purifier. Don't suppose you have a spare? No worries. I'm heading their way. Wanna come with?
	</p><p>
	"In all things, a calm heart must prevail."
	</p><p>
	Taking that as a yes.
	</p>

    <div class="section" id="sect_seg16">Epilogue</div>
	<p>
	[The following is excerpted from a recording of Tycho's eulogy, delivered by Sentinel Sarah Lyons.]
	</p><p>
	After the firefight, we cornered Colonel Autumn at the water purifier. So imagine the scene: impasse at the JeffMo rotunda, surrounded by Project Purity and the corpses of Enclave shock troops. We're all on edge, pointing guns at each other. And what does he do? He drops his blinking plasma rifle, walks up to Autumn, and convinces him to stand down! Classic Tycho. I wasn't about to deny him his choice. And that is why Autumn lies in solitary awaiting tribunal, instead of buried six feet under, taking the location of the G.E.C.K. with him.
	</p><p>
	Anyway, the damage to the Purifier was extensive, and Autumn had just fled when Dr. Li announced over the intercom that the nuclear core was about to go critical. Someone had to enter the irradiated control room and stop it somehow. There was a keypad on the control console inside, but nobody knew the shutdown code. Not even Dr. Li. Suicide mission if I ever saw one.
	</p><p>
	We all hesitated. We'd come all this way, only to see everything go up in a goddamn mushroom cloud? Tycho got this far look in his eye as he stared into the control room where his father had died. Fawkes was with us, immune to radiation. Tycho could have just told him the code, asked the bloody supermutant to do it. But the Purifier was James' baby. And as Tycho once admitted, he was his father's son....
	</p><p>
	Well, he was too fast, and I was too damn slow. Once Tycho locked himself inside, he walked over to the control panel, typed in three numbers. Maybe he wasn't sure about the code, maybe he couldn't risk a friend on a hunch. I don't know. But his intuition was spot on: 2-1-6. In retrospect, the code was clearly taken from the passage his parents admired, Revelations 21:6, which Dad... which Elder Lyons just read. We all know what happened next.
	</p><p>
	[pause]
	</p><p>
	Excuse me. So dusty in here... Frak.
	</p><p>
	[pause]
	</p><p>
	You know that was his word. [laugh] Every fifth word.
	</p><p>
	[scattered laughter]
	</p><p>
	He may have not voiced it, but Tycho shared his father's dreams, just as he adopted so many others' dreams. Just as he helped bring so many of them to fruition. I often wonder what his own dreams were?
	</p><p>
	One thing we know for sure is he ultimately shared his father's sacrifice. And because of this, the Capitol wasteland is now an oasis of hope. The Enclave is broken and on the run.
	</p><p>
	[pause for shouts of "Oorah", interspersed with calls for silence]
	</p><p>
	No, it's OK, let 'em shout. I'm sure Tycho would have shouted too.
	</p><p>
	[shouts continue, then die down]
	</p><p>
	Today, Aqua Pura flows freely from the Jefferson Memorial, and by caravan out into the wasteland. Project Purity is the greatest humanitarian success we have seen in generations.
	</p><p>
	[raucous applause]
	</p><p>
	Many of you know Tycho had a PipBoy. [laugh] Yeah, when I first saw him in that alley in Chevy Chase, I thought, "How did this trashy wastelander score a PipBoy?"
	</p><p>
	[scattered laughter]
	</p><p>
	But you may not know he kept the autorecorder function on, and he was constantly mumbling into it as he traveled. Scribe Jameson has been recovering what entries weren't munged by radiation, and as his commanding officer, I've been pouring over them. In one entry, Tycho called his conscience a curse. Would that we were all so blessed with that curse.
	</p><p>
	His conscience fueled his bravery. Three Dog still broadcasts many tales of "that crazy sonnuvabitch", and I'm sure they grow taller with each telling. But you might not have heard about his actions during the storming of JeffMo. Mostly because I have yet to write them up. (Sorry, sir.)
	</p><p>
	[scattered laughter]
	</p><p>
	But this is truth. As Liberty Prime stomped ahead of us, the rear guard got pinned at a choke point just before the bridge. Two nests of Enclave snipers. Two paladins down. Out of nowhere, Tycho and that yappy mutt of his stormed the snipers' nests like it was just another walk in the wasteland. He'd doubled back from the vanguard. When he found me, he said he didn't want me to miss all the fun.
	</p><p>
	[scattered laughter]
	</p><p>
	[mumbled] Time to end this crappy ceremony.
	</p><p>
	No finer soldier have I commanded in the Pride. And I'm not saying that just because he saved our asses. But I'm also not <em>not</em> saying that. Well, whatever.
	</p><p>
	Godspeed, Tycho.
