<b><h3>Chapter 1: ...the first thing I remember</h3></b>

I was making my way through desert. Yes. I remember it all. 
The endless sand and rocks. The sun shining on me, so hot, 
the heat was tremendous. But I walked on checking my heading 
regularly. Drinking sparingly from my canteen. Eating a bit of 
dry food twice a day. I had no idea where I had gotten the canteen 
or food or even the clothes I was wearing. They were army clothes. 
They fit me well and seemed familiar and were comfortable, so they 
probably were mine. My name is Eric Haven, U.S. Army corporal. At 
least I believe that is my name. It is the name in the dog tags I
was wearing. I was making my way through the desert. That is the 
first thing I remember.
<p>
The next thing I remember was seeing movement in the distance. 
I immediately laid down and crawled behind some rocks. Then I 
took out my (?) binoculars and observed the source of the movement. 
It was strange. Why did I do that? It was almost instinctive. I must 
have learned to do that somewhere. But where? Or when?
<p>
Anyway, the scene that I saw seemed very strange to me. There was a 
train being pulled by cattle. Why did they do that? Trains had 
engines. Why didn't they use the engine? Then I looked around the 
train. There were several people walking next to the train. They 
looked like they were some sort of nomads. They didn't seem hostile. 
Even if they were, I didn't have much choice but to make contact 
with them. I couldn't just go on wandering in the desert. I had no 
idea where I was (or did I?). Besides, those tracks must lead 
somewhere. So I decided to go and greet them or something...
<p>
I stumbled down towards the track yelling something to the nomads. 
I was in worse shape than I had realised. Heat, hunger and thirst 
had gotten to me. The colors started to distort when I was about 
fifty feet from the train. I stumbled on, and the world started to 
blur and my ears started hissing strangely. A young boy yelled 
something to the others. I couldn't make out what. The train 
stopped. Then the world blacked out totally and I fainted.
<p>
I woke up in a car. I felt it moving slowly, probably being pulled 
by the cattle. I was lying on a mattress and surrounded by several 
nomads sitting around me. One of them told a young boy to get the 
engineer. Another one offered me water, which I drunk little by 
little. Then the engineer arrived.
<p>
"Who are you?" the man wearing a train engineer's cap asked me. 
"You are wearing a uniform. Are you a ranger?"
<p>
I was pretty dazed. "Ranger? I'm not a ranger... I think."
<p>
"Then who are you?" the engineer asked.
<p>
"My name is Eric Haven, probably", All I remembered was that I was 
wandering in the desert with this equipment. Including the dog tags, 
"Eric Haven, U.S. Army corporal."
<p>
"U.S. Army? The army hasn't been around for over 80 years. I guess 
you're not from around here. Nowadays  the closest thing to army 
around here are the Desert Rangers." The engineer seemed puzzled.
<p>
"I AM an army corporal. I remember that." Yes. I remembered that. 
I was sure of that. "I am an U.S. Army soldier", so these Rangers 
are the closest thing to army around here. Maybe I should seek them 
out. At least I should be able to make myself useful or get some
information on what the hell is going on, "Do you know 
where these rangers are located?"
<p>
"Well, there is the Ranger Center. It is their training center, 
barracks and headquarters", the engineer told me.
<p>
"Okay then, that's my best shot", I don't think I know how to do 
anything else than being a soldier, "Can you help me there?" my 
interest was going up every second.
<p>
"Well, the tracks don't go to the Ranger Center or anywhere near 
within the next few days. We'll be passing Quartz the day after 
tomorrow. We'll drop you off there. You should be able to find some 
rangers there who can help you. Ranger Center is a bit southeast 
from Quartz." the engineer instructed me.
<p>
"Thanks. By the way, why do you pull the train with cattle instead 
of using the engine." I wondered. That odd detail had almost escaped 
my mind.
<p>
The engineer suddenly looked like he was going to rip my head off, 
"What are you talking about?! You'll anger the gods with that kind 
of talking and bring misfortune upon us all!"
<p>
The engine was apparently a taboo or something to these fellas. 
I tried to calm the engineer down the best I could "I apologize. 
I didn't know how delicate this matter was to you. Please pray for 
the gods to forgive me my words."
<p>
"I accept your apology. And I'm sure the gods do also", the engineer 
was leaving as he seemed to remember something, "Perhaps you should 
visit our oracle. He probably can help you", then he stood up 
and left.
<p>
I stared at the ceiling of the car and pondered the situation. 
I was travelling with some strange rail nomads to find some 
army-like institute called the "Desert Rangers". I didn't have 
much idea about who I was. My name is Eric Haven. As I thought 
about the name, it gained more familiar ring to it. I am Eric 
Haven. I am also a corporal in the U.S. Army. Or I was. 
The U.S. Army doesn't seem to exist anymore. Instead there are 
these desert rangers, who seem to account pretty much for the 
same thing. This whole world seemed strange and new, I didn't 
know exactly why. And I sure as hell didn't know what I was 
going to do here. But I am a soldier, so I probably have some 
skills associated with the occupation, so I should be able to 
make myself useful with these desert rangers.
<p>
Wait... skills... I thought about it. Yes. I remember something, 
or rather I know how to do something... reloading a pistol... the 
safety catch... Hold it. I have a pistol don't I? Yes. In a holster 
on the belt. Funny, I hadn't noticed the whole thing before. 
I pulled it out. Some nomads were startled by it and pulled back. 
But I wasn't going to shoot anybody, just try and see what I knew. 
I recognized the pistol immediately. A .44 Magnum Desert Eagle pistol 
with a clip of seven .44 cartridges. I fiddled with the pistol for 
a while. I removed the clip. I knew excactly how to do it. Full 
clip. The Desert Eagle was in perfect condition. It felt good in 
my hand. I had handled this thing before, I was sure of that. 
However, I decided to holster it again in order to not scare the 
nomads any more.
<p>
After some time I started feeling drowsy. I was still pretty weak. 
Soon I drifted into deep sleep as the train continued rolling slowly 
on the tracks.
