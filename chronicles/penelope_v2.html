<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>I rounded the corner the same time they did.</P>
<P>Penelope behind me was caught off guard and shrieked, unholstering her uzi and clapping both her hands onto it.  Eight of them, glimmering and slimy metal in the disgusting light of the ancient sewers.  I, Ishmael, let my M1989A1 NATO assault rifle let fly all 35 bullets in the clip in rapid succession, ripping holes in the grotesque death machines.  As if programmed to do so, Chagrin's AK97 and Penelope's 9mm Uzi followed suite, and in less than 15 seconds, 117 bullets were tossed toward the grimy cyborg hides, and materialized 117 white-hot holes in all eight robots.  With an electronic screech the band of killer androids was mowed down to a sizzling pulp in the wide sewer junction.  </P>
<P>It was another kill.  Another slaughter.  These sewers had seen many such one-sided victories since I brought the team down here.  Everything had been fine with the cyborgs down here, until they started moving up to the surface.  Sure… that’s when everyone gets angry and fussy.  So maybe if a team of armed rangers jumps down the slimy manholes and destroys a few of them, they’ll stop.  Right.  </P>
<P>Everyone knows cyborgs aren’t <I>real</I> cyborgs.  Real cyborgs can reproduce themselves.  People call them cyborgs for lack of a better term.  These monstrosities that threaten the surface are manufactured somewhere.  They have to be.  The things we’re killing down here aren’t living enough, they are too much machine to reproduce.</P>
<P>It was then that we realized our mistake.  At nine o'clock the clawers rushed in through another passage, resuming the ear-piercing war screech that the cyborgs before had perished with.  And me with an empty rifle.  Chagrin had his shimmering energized proton axe out of its sling and through the torso of one cyborg before any could speak to cry ambush.  When someone did, it was muffled by the slow, violent <I>thud-thud-thud-thud-thud</I> of Poindexter's trusty M16, the 7.62mm slugs mashing small shafts throughout the clawer's makeshift armor.  One clawer took an M16 shot in the optical sensor, and the thick green mechanical fluid of optical imager leaked out.</P>
<P>I let one of the raging clawers have the butt of my assault rifle in full stride, and I drove it's thin cranium into the ground.  Another clawer jumped at me from above it.  I could only look in horror as the terrible killer's metallic talons slashed.  If it weren't for Penelope's half-clip of 9mm slugs that utterly gutted and pounded the beast to oblivion I would have been mincemeat myself.  I never could figure out how Penelope slapped a clip in and out of that black metal rectangle so quickly; but, she did, and I never complained.  Penelope was always there with a smile and a full clip of ammo in her weapon.  Its what I wanted, and expected, from any woman.  Some will call me callous for believing that, but in battle, lipstick and sewing skills are useless.  So learn to shoot a submachine gun.</P>
<P>As Chagrin cleaved another death machine into indistinguishable parts, I dug for a clip in my ammo pouch.  The most damaging weapon and the prize of heavy thug and gunman combat, my assault rifle dutifully replacing the aging and jam-prone AK47 I used to tote.  The older AK did pack a bigger, rougher punch... when it fired.  I looked at Penelope and smiled as we synchronously reached for ammo.  I had only used one, but she had already emptied 90 bullets, 3 clips.  Amazing.</P>
<P>All I heard were two <I>chi-chlack</I>s as Penelope reloaded again.  Not only could she reload quickly, but she was the fastest ammo-burner I ever knew.  If there was ever a time she did keep 30 slugs in her gun for an extended period of time in combat, I wasn't there to remember it.  So now that I think about it… Penelope almost never had a full clip of ammo in her weapon.  Usually her clip was coming to rest in the bowels of some enemy, alive or robotic, and that's something else I expected from almost any woman.  She was like greased lighting in combat, beautiful and graceful, dodging, diving, viciously attacking... the perfect ranger.  </P>
<P>I fell back in the rank, behind the tall and lanky Poindexter, subconsciously.  Why, I wasn't sure, but in doing so I freed up a firing lane for Poindexter, who plugged another claw full of holes.  When I returned out of a reminiscent gaze I found myself behind our tall resident genius, Poindexter, holding my side.  I moved my hand and my finger slid into my side, into the precise incision the clawer had made straight through my flak jacket.  I nearly hulched in agony as I coughed and the wound burned furiously.  I handed noticed it until I aggravated it.  The clawer had gotten me right below the rib-cage.  Would they ever stop coming?  I could do nothing as I saw Chagrin's Proton Ax bluntly whack a clawer with the wide broadside of the axe as another clawer shoved him off-balance.  Poindexter held his rifle in his arm pit, letting off a shot at a rate of two per second, using the semi-automatic option.  The M16 was slowly felling down the racing, two-legged robots, whose oversized claws seemed to weigh down a stout and hunched torso.  They looked like muscular monkeys with huge metal gloves on, running around on short powerful legs.  I crouched back to the wall in a half-sit, half-stand position, trying to hold my M1989A1 up and level, but I couldn't.  </P>
<P>Nerve poison.  The robots had developed nerve poison.  I might be out for a half- hour, an hour, maybe even a day or two.  And down here in the sewers was no place to be paralyzed.  </P>
<P>"Penelop...e..." I said with numb lips.  By some swing of chance our eyes met.  She turned back around, first a burst into a staggering clawer, and dashed toward me.  She bent over me as I fell down to sitting nearly on my back.  Something hurt badly.  She followed my left arm down to my side and saw the spreading red blotch in my shirt.  She lifted up my hand.</P>
<P>"My God, Ish!  We better get you cleaned up..." and to the tall, lanky Brit, "Cover me, Dexter!"  He looked back and nodded, and flipped his rifle to automatic mode.  The slow, monotonous thundering changed to an all-out cacophony of titanic bursts of sound, completely drowning out all noise, and engulfing three clawers in a hellfire of bullets, raking them to the sewer wall and riddling their frail bodies with holes.  Penelope put down her weapon and wiped the wound clean with some alcohol-soaked rags in her knapsack.  I saw a clawer charging Poindexter from his blindspot-side, and opened my mouth to cry out, but I was starting to have trouble breathing.  I had to stop and let my autonomic take over breathing, or I would strangle myself .  "Poindexter, hurry and come patch Ish up!"  Penelope looked up at me from my gushing side, saw my expression and followed my line of sight.   In one swift motion she grabbed her loaded (as always) uzi and swung in a crouch a full 180 degrees, mowing down the short clawer before it could slash our medic.  Poindexter turned around and smiled at Penelope, who gave a wink through her flailing yellow pony-tail as she pulled out another clip and let another smoking empty cartridge clank to the ground.  </P>
<P>She turned back to me, with a smile on her face.  </P>
<P>"Hang in there, sport, we'll have you out of here in no time at all."  What a great friend this woman was.  She leaned forward and gave my sweaty, grimy cheek a kiss as Poindexter let loose another ravaging explosion of fully automatic ammunition, backpedaling toward me.  Those cyborg scum must be dying out now, I deliriously thought.</P>
<P>We all heard Chagrin roar a fearsome roar as his back was scraped by a metal claw.  Poindexter turned and clicked his rifle back to semiautomatic mode, and with excellent marksmanship, dropped dead two clawers struggling within two feet of our massive brawler.  I smiled and suddenly felt a rush of numbness wash over me.  My hearing lulled down to a soft, echoing drone and my eyesight became a sea of lights.  I was going out.  </P>
<P>I grabbed Penelope's hand off my side as she was rising and squeezed, bearing my teeth as I lost consciousness, to loud, near shouts of, </P>
<P>"Ish!  Ish!  You okay?  We won!  We got 'em all!  Come on, stay with us Ish!....."</P>

<P>I woke up in a bright daze.  The sun beat down on us.  The ground had the familiar texture of sand.  I rolled my finger in it, lovingly, through the warmth.  My mind was still very delirious.</P>
<P>"He's awake."  That was Poindexter.  Good ol' Poindexter.  The most Catholic ranger there was.  Beside dog tags he wore a sterling silver cross, and did the sign of the cross after each successful battle.  Kindof respected him for it, too.  I'm not a religious boy, never had a faith or knew one, but I trusted in my friends.  I trusted in Chagrin, Poindexter, and especially Penelope.  Good ol' Penelope.  </P>
<P>My eyesight stared to fill my head with painful brightness, so I squeezed my eyelids shut.</P>
<P>We went through Advanced Technical training together, one of the toughest courses offered back at HQ ranger school.  She had wonderful grasp on the inner workings of guns.  She loved guns.  Tried to build one one time... never managed to get the parts from Highpool.  Too bad, too.  She was going to name it the PI200, the Penelope-Ishmael 200, mostly because I helped her pay for the parts Highpool did have for sale.  She was going to use the plentiful but useless .45 slugs that nothing shot anymore, but HQ had stocks upon stocks of.  She figured she'd never have to worry about ammo any more...</P>
<P>"You okay, man?" That was Ralf, our resident hobo.  Not good for much around the party, but managed to tote just enough weight in combat with his makeshift M19 automatic rifle.  Funny guy.  Drank alot.  Found him in death row, it was kind of funny.  But that’s a different story completely.  I could use a drink now...</P>
<P>"I think so.  His finger moved."</P>
<P>Mort was his literal sidekick and soulmate.  Just a dimwitted and minimally talented.  We found him in jail in Needles.  Not quite as alcoholic as Ralf but just as delinquent.  Mort was 'allergic' to gun oil so he stuck to using demolitions whenever possible.  Hand grenades mostly, but in the sewers high explosives had the nasty habit of bringing down ground supports.</P>
<P>Ralf and Mort had decided to stay above.  They had their radio turned on at all times to the ranger's frequency.  Poindexter had lost our radio deep in the sewers in a scuffle with a really ornery hexborg hiding in the rafters.  We were knee-deep in muck and the damn robot was laying down sheets of ammo- ah hell, it's no use explaining.  Chagrin finally took the bastard down with a LAW rocket after Penelope had lit him up a bit by plugging some holes in his with random upward bursts of ammo.  That sucker flashed and sparked like the freaking fourth of July when Penelope enticed him a bit with some 9mm-wide holes.  Penelope could do that.  With a smile she'd level off that wicked black uzi and let it fly, never letting the recoil reach her elbows, just like a good Ranger, but letting it kick back a bit in the wrists.  Her face jiggled a bit as she would empty 30 slugs, but usually she kept that almost innate and irremovable smile.  Boy, she sure plowed that one hexborg, almost knocked the freakin' thing off it's powerful 6-legged stance.</P>
<P>I moved my head in the sand, still very dizzy and feeling intoxicated...</P>
<P>When I finally did come to I wanted to be sure to thank Penelope for saving my butt down in the sewers.  Not in front of everyone, though, of course.  The guys might think things.  It’s not like I have a chance with her anyway.  Or her with me, naturally.  We’re more of brother and sister than husband and wife.  Platonic.  Besides, I’m not the marrying kind of man.  I’m not sure if she is.  I suppose I could imagine her with a nice guy out in the scrub with a white picket fence.  A vegetable garden.  No, a flower garden.  The guy who marries her better like flowers.  Penelope likes desert flowers.  The big bright sunflowers that manage to grow in Highpool, mostly.  Every now and then I’ll find a desert wild flower and give it to her, pretending that I knew what it was really called.  I think I like flowers.</P>
<P>An involuntary cough cleared my throat.  The nose and throat burned, my lungs too.  I turned on my side and coughed so more, clearing some sand out of my chest.</P>
<P>"No sewers?  Boy, we didn't even expect that first ground and then the clawers came in... boy, I wish you could've been there, Mort, it was like a smooth groove our team got into when the battle started..." I mumbled, joyously and sarcastically.  I coughed again, faking it this time, just to add the ‘wounded’ effect.  Mort didn't reply.  No one spoke for a while.  I almost fell back to sleep.</P>
<P>"No, we got out of that scumhole." Chagrin's low, gruff voice assailed and greeted my ears with welcome serious familiarity.  &quot;We got out alright.&quot;</P>
<P>"Where's Penelope?  I want to know if she has any ammo left." I asked playingly.  I knew she would laugh and answer.  </P>
<P>She didn't.  No one did.  </P>
<P>My expression changed from weak smile to worried frown.  All of a sudden Poindexter boyishly blurted,</P>
<P>"I couldn't do anythun'!  They busted out of the walls, out of the water, everywhere!  They were on top of us in no time, and everyone with confused and disoriented-"  I heard the rustling of clothes.  Now I forced open my eyes.  My head cleared quickly.  My arms tingled with anxiety.  Chagrin had grabbed Poindexter's shirt sleeve and squeezed it, a motion to shut up.  </P>
<P>Chagrin took a deep breath and exhaled slowly.</P>
<P>"Penelope caught burst of bullets in the back.  Her armor couldn't stop it.  It was too close a range."</P>
<P>The words burned.  Etched themselves down in my head.</P>
<P>I took the news hard.  It struck me in the back of the throat.  Hard.</P>
<P>"What was it?  Another hexborg?"  No one answered.  "Tell me!" </P>
<P>There was silence until Poindexter broke the silence with a British-accented half-shout, half-sob.</P>
<P>"It was me!  It was me, okay."  Poindexter fought back the tears.  "They surprised me badly.  I didn't want a big firefight with you prone on Chagrin's back.  We were all in less than ten feet of space-"</P>
<P>It was I that stopped him this time.  My eyes and throat were both burning.  I felt sorry for Poindexter.  He was telling the truth.  And it slapped me in the face.  </P>
<P>Hard.  Dexter wouldn't lie to save his grandmother.  He was a good man.  But right now I didn't know what to think about him.</P>
<P>Chagrin spoke up, in a dead, monotone voice.</P>
<P>"We were hemmed in by cyberpunks.  They got between us, beneath us, over us, and I even would have taken Poindexter's head off...  They were playing with us.  They must have smelt your blood and their poison.  It was a bloody fight, and it was over in about a minute.  I heard Penelope scream and saw her go down toward the end.  We thought Penelope had been gunned by a cyberpunk rifle, but Dexter just kept standing there, motionless, with his rifle pointed straight at her back.  It was dark and everyone was shouting... but... that doesn't really matter, does it...."</P>
<P>Chagrin was right.  I didn't want an explanation.  I didn't want confession.  Hell, I didn't even care for truth.  All I wanted was anger.  Destroy the sewers.  Destroy the cyborgs.  Each and every damn cyborg in all of Vegas, above and below, to annihilate and obliterate all artificial intelligence, all the death-bringing dogs that dared to claim semi-sentience.  I felt the bandage on my side, and grabbed my rifle.</P>

<P>We passed Penelope's grave on the way back into Vegas.  A small tombstone with the words "Veni, vedi, vici" inscribed in crudely shaped letters by Dexter stood at the head of the pile of rocks and sand.  Chagrin had lovingly placed an empty VP1ZA1 automatic pistol and a dried desert wildflower on it out of respect for the woman, ranger, warrior, and friend.  For my tribute, I picked up the pistol.  </P>
<P>And clapped a full clip into it.  </P>
<P>We were off before the dust had settled.</P>

<P>By night we had regained our subterranean territory in the sewers.  We walked briskly in a spread-out cluster, Dexter and I took point, and Chagrin and Mort took the rear.  (Mort had taken to using a crowbar instead of explosives.  His frame was deceptive, hours at the prison pull-up bar had thickened his arms to unproportionality.)  Ralf was in the middle of the star, nervously holding his rifle level.  Ralf hadn’t seen much combat besides youthful street brawls.  </P>
<P>I walked side by side with Poindexter, Dexter for short, who had always been my friend.  I still didn't hate the man for the incident.  I still trusted him, too.  It was these blasted cyborgs that I hated.  None of us ever expected cyborgs this sophisticated.  The first time we found a hexborg we killed it with morbid curiosity.    And none of us, including Penelope, expected to loose one of our own... to of one of our own.</P>
<P>As we walked with weapons drawn and level and locked and loaded, I turned my head and looked into Poindexter's eyes.  It was several moments before he noticed me, and he stared back into my own.  Thick and opaque brown stones stared loosely into my own blue ones.  The were filled with frustration and pain.  Hurt... this man was hurting.  Ofcourse, I thought, he had accidentally gunned down a fellow ranger and companion.  He had lost Penelope's friendship, irreparably damaged my friendship, scarred his reputation with the rest of the group as well as the United States Ranger Corp.  But most importantly this Englishman had lost himself in sorrow and regret.  It was said once that the eyes are the gateways to the inner spirit.  It is a sad thing to witness first-hand the destruction of a soul.</P>
<P>The eerie, green and slimy halls of the sewers and the huge, opened yet stuffy exchange chambers, water-transfer tubes long since operational, echoed sounds from miles of tunnel around.  The sewers were uncharacteristically empty tonight, bereft of their usually cyberpunk and clawer squeal, echoing throughout the miles of underground sewer.  The party treaded bravely through the huge chambers, expecting laser bursts and auto-rifle shots to pierce the empty white noise any second.  It wasn't until we had trudged almost a mile underground that the hideous machines pounced.</P>
<P>It seemed that all the evil and scum the sewers had hoarded in the years since the bombs had collected in this one point and converged onto us, the one enemy.  I don't think my M1989A1 NATO assault rifle ever worked cleaner, swifter, or deadlier.  With a feverish fervor I let my steel monster devour clip after clip of depleted uranium bullets, spitting the smoking fangs into the hides of cyberpunks, clawers, and the occasional hexborg that showed its ugly polygonal face.  With instinctive, near-feral reactions I used both ends of my weapon, the thick metallic butt when combat got too close.  I heard the death-bringing thuds of Poindexter's M16 behind me.  Twice we backed into each other.  I trusted Poindexter, and after this glorious victory I planned on telling him how much I had learned to respect and honor him.  I also heard the metallic pings of Chagrin's AK97 off to my left, and the ruckus of Ralf's old rusty rifle to my right.  The battle tide had been rolling our way since the start, and I was unstoppable, undefeatable, indestructible, invincible, infallible.  I was a rolling tide of destruction for these electronic demons.  </P>
<P>The cyberpunks almost looked human.  They were slightly humanoid, often with human-like skin coloring and carrying weapons the same way humans did, with two dexterous metallic hands.  I crossed over left and plugged a cyberpunk hard, four times thick in the chest.  I felt the rush of motion behind me and jabbed back under my arm, feeling the butt of my rifle slam something hollow and metallic, hard and quick.  I turned a full 180<FONT FACE="Symbol">°</FONT> and saw a clawer with a gaping dent splitting it's head armor down the center, and it was stumbling backwards, groping at what used to be it's cranium.  </P>
<P>I tossed my rifle around and sent a bullet straight through the crevice, splitting it's  insane robot head into a hundred parts.  </P>
<P>Something moved toward me to my right.  I swung, and in the same motion I squeezed the trigger in full automatic mode.   </P>
<P>I looked straight into Poindexter's eyes.  </P>
<P>There were five, muffled, immutable, and deafeningly loud explosions in my arms.</P>
<P>My trigger finger convulsed and my hand ripped itself away from the handle, shaking.</P>
<P>His eyes glazed over and then relaxed.  </P>
<P>The furious noise of the battle faded.</P>
<P>His expression turned blank.</P>
<P>His mouth opened a bit and his throat clicked.</P>
<P>The world seemed to warp itself back to normal proportions in my eyes.  All my senses coalesced onto Dexter's eyes.  They spoke, and as I held my heated rifle inches from the tall, lanky ranger's bloody stomach, I heard them.  We had won, they said, we had smashed those filthy bastards to next Wednesday.  You had been successful, they said.  The memories and death of Penelope were avenged, revenge had been served to you on a silver platter, his eyes said to me, as the irises thinned and the black pupil enlarged.</P>
<P>Congratulations to you, Ishmael.  </P>
<P>You've won now.  And I'm sorry.</P>
<P>His wicked M16 clanked to the floor next to some clawer parts, smoking and separated from the main, destroyed, body.  His arms surged outward and his hands grabbed my forearms, squeezing tight.  His jaw dropped down, and his throat cracked, as if to try to speak.  I dropped my own weapon and was paralyzed.  My hands reached for his as he slipped down, sliding off my legs, his eyes following mine in their descent.  He collapsed to his knees, and I did too.  He couldn't talk.  His arms convulsed and his shoulders shivered with an unnatural cold.  His eyes turned away and his mouth tried to move.  But his eyes had said enough.  I wanted to tell him to shut up, for he had, in a way, said enough to me already.  I hadn't realized but my jaw was slack and my throat dry, and my own eyes as dead and wide as Dexter's were now.  Dex fell forward onto me, his hands squeezing hard and long.  His strong frame gave off one last weak gasp, and he died in my hands.</P>
