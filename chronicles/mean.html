by V</h4>

Vince and Anthony, two Desert Rangers and brothers, sat in the desert near Las
Vegas.  Tachikawa Fuiji, an ex-assassin and current Ranger in Anthony’s squad,
the Anti-Muties, was on the ground unconcious with a few nasty wounds. Vince,
a smart one (IQ:23), was patching up Tachikawa with his Doctor skills. They
had just gotten their butts kicked in Las Vegas and needed to think about what
to do. Ace, Christina, and Mayor Pedros were also sitting there, next to
Blackwolf, who’s heavy Apache descent already made him a skilled warrior.
They were all waiting for their wounds to heal.
<P>
"Nice one Ace....  'LETS GO TO LAS VEGAS!'  Now Tachikawa’s bleeding all over
my Rad-Suit!"
<P>
Vince griped at Ace as he sewed up Tachikawa.  "You should’ve told us to go get some better
gear and maybe WARNED us about that Scorpitron!"
<P>
"Listen, dude, there’s somethin’ nasty goin’ down in Las Vegas. We gotta solve the problem
ASAP!" Ace replied, dropping his UZI. Even Christina threw her beloved submachine-gun out
and decided to use an assault-rifle. This was mainly because they just realized where
they’re going, SMGs are about as effective as harsh language.
<P>
"We shouldn’t argue... the warrior should not quarrel with his own men," Blackwolf said
solemnly. He was staring at the city in the distance. In his hand the M1989A1, decorated
with raw-hide and Nuke Pooch teeth, was dangling from his hand. He sat down to re-apply
his black war-paint.
<P>
"Will you guys shut up!?" Christina growled. "Why don’t we go back to Needles and go
help them with that Bloodstaff crisis!?"
<P>
Anthony finally spoke up. "Alright. Let's move."

<P>-----------------------</P>

<P>
After shooting robots full of holes, rescuing some nasty bum that got shot by a Killer
and died, and jumping over chess-board puzzles, Anthony and his squad were standing before
the large robot. Answering "thirty!" they were cast down and landed in a heap on the dock.
<P>"GAHH! ACE! GET OFF OF ME!! YOUR ASSAULT RIFLE’S ON MY GROIN!!!" Vince yelled in
aggravation and agony, for he had landed on the bottom, and now had six other people piled
on top of him.
<P>
"Rghh... well, there’s a dock! And there’s an island in the distance. I bet that's
where they’re keeping the Bloodstaff." Anthony said as he stood up. Mayor Pedros,
Christina, and Ace all stood up, pointing their rifles at the island. They knew it was
problably guarded, but there wasn’t anyone there. They also knew Vince and Anthony
were the only ones who’s armor could withstand the moat-scum and problably swim.
<P>"Hmm... Tachikawa, Blackwolf... you guys stay here with Ace. Me and Vince will
go get the Bloodstaff!" Anthony ordered as he jumped into the water, pulling Vince with
him. They began kicking and splashing until they finally reached the island.
<P>
<em>PA-TOOGN!</em> A bullet richoceted off a wall near Vince’s head. Quickly ducking down as
more bullets came, they worked their way around a corner and spotted the Sniper.
<P>
<em>RATATATATATATATATATAT!!!</em>
<P>
Vince ripped a clip, turning the Sniper into an undertaker’s nightmare as he raked him
full of lead. Casually reloading as if nothing happened, Vince followed Anthony up to
the other corner, spotting another Sniper who was smoking a cigarette, looking at
the moat.
<P>
<em>RATATAT! RATATAT!</em>
<P>
As if acting as one, the two U.S./Italian brothers fired two synchronized bursts into the
Sniper, exploding him like a bloodsausage. They smirked and then went to the big gate.
<P>
"Damn it... we should’ve taken Tachikawa... he knows how to pick locks. We’re screwed,"
Vince mumbled. Just then Anthony pulled a stick of TNT from his backpack and placed it
on the door. One large explosion later, they were in, barely missing the pressure-plate
that activated the HUGE anti-tank laser mounted on the opposite wall. After taking turns
ripping clips while the other reloaded, the horde of gaurds and Bloodbeasts were all piles
of corpses, blood flowing from their wounds and making the ground slick. Vince
and Anthony worked their way around and busted open the other door, revealing more Bloodbeasts
and even the Bloodpriest. Bullets screamed from their NATO’s as they riddled every living
thing not wearing a "RANGER" tag full of holes. Limbs were exploding, brains were spewing,
bullets were maiming, and until finally the two Rangers came out victorious (only very
very hurt). Looting everything they could carry, Vince and Anthony’s backpacks were
full of Power-Packs, LAW Rockets, money....and the REAL Bloodstaff.
<P>
"Heheheheh...ow..." Vince chuckled as he pulled a bullet out of his shoulder crudely.
They had just solved the Bloodstaff crisis, and knew he and his brother would
problably get a big promotion for this.

<P>----------------------</P>

<P>
"Ahhh... I like this Kevlar Suit." Vince chuckled as the squad sat in the jeep,
Ace driving them towards Las Vegas once more. Anthony sat there, resting, while
Tachikawa played with his new toy, an AK-97 assault rifle.  The jeep began spluttering,
and Ace pulled over in Needles.
<P>
"Gosh darn it.... no way we’re payin’ for this piece of crap jeep to get fixed." Ace
mumbled as he hopped out of the jeep. The rest of the squad stood up and climbed from
the automobile, grumbling. Looks like they’re going to have to walk to Las Vegas...

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>
"Damn Warroids... whatever Mark they are," Vince grumbled as he walked past the
smoldering heaps of scrap-metal, his assault-rifle not the only one smoking. The
Warroids seemed to attack in groups and are very annoying, especially when trying
to out-run a Scorpitron<sup>TM</sup> when they pop up from nowhere and join the fray.
Vince and the others still couldn’t go to Fat Freddy’s because the large android
scorpion kept blowing everything up that even stepped foot in its sensors.
Vince was really beginning to hate artificial-intellegence.

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>
Blackwolf sat there, holding his AK-97 at the ready while the others slept. He crept
around the corner, spotting a few Warroids. As if each and every one of those tanks
were responsible for the death of his mother, he begin viciously firing into them,
piercing them full of 7.62mm holes until nothing was left but a pile of smoking metal
and circuitry. He then went back into the building.
<P>
Next morning, the Rangers awoke. Mayor Pedros stretched, while Tachikawa picked up
a newly-acquired RPG-7 and slung it over his shoulder. Grabbing his trusty NATO,
the Chinese ex-terrorist/assassin was pretty much ready for whatever came his
way... as long as it didn’t have the word SCORPITRON in it. Tachikawa then slid
his Kevlar-Vest on. Anthony stood, picking up his own M1989A1 NATO and put on his
Rad-Suit. Christina was still asleep, so Vince gave the commandoette a swift kick in
the shin to arouse her. As if by reflex, she sent a beer bottle crashing against Vince’s
head and levelled her gun at him.
<P>
"Aghh... Ow. Sorry..." Vince mumbled as he picked a piece of broken glass from his
forehead. Vince took fifteen minutes to strap on his Kevlar Suit, while the others
ate breakfast.
<P>
"Alright.  How do we get rid of that damn Scorpitron?" Ace proposed while he chewed
on his Iguana-On-A-Stick.
<P>
"Conventional firearms are useless... so far I’ve wasted five clips on it! Thats
one-hundred seventy-five bullets!" Vince barked. He was sitting there, cleaning his
RPG-7. Last thing he wanted was for a rocket to misfire.
<P>
"I’ll say... the Scorpitron eats bullets for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. I’ve wasted
about seven clips on it." Christina added.
<P>
"Hmm... mebbe we could use deese rockits on it." Mayor Pedros suggested. He noticed
that Vince came across a large stash of RPGs and LAWs when he killed off some
scavs in Las Vegas. Only problem is that most of their AT Weapon Skills were only
level 1’s or 2’s.
<P>
"We problably could, but none of us have that good of an aim with these things."
Blackwolf said solemnly. He was still reminiscing over blowing a squad of Warroids
away with one clip. That took some skill (Assault Rifle: 4, anyway).
<P>
"Mebbe we could find somebody in the prison," Anthony remarked, polishing his NATO.
<P>
"I guess we could, but most of the people we find captive always suck." Vince replied.
"There was Mort, Ralf, Danny.... they were in prison. And you know where they are now?
DEAD. Damn bastiches couldn’t even last in wastes even when we gave them a friggin’
AK-97!"
<P>
"I was in prison, and i’m still alive." Ace retorted.
<P>
"So? You’re a lucky we found you. Besides, you’re already good with all sorts of
weapons." Vince retorted in retort, or something like that.
<P>
"We need to go to the prison." Tachikawa finally spoke up. "I came across a bum
that said there was this man named Covenant somewhere missing. My bet is that he is
in prison."
<P>
"Alright then.... We’ll go to the prison."

<P>-----------------------</P>

Ten dead Cyborg Commando’s later, Anthony is decked out in a Kevlar-Suit and most of the Rangers’ ammo
problems have been solved. Mayor Pedros had been blown into chunky bits of meat-kibble when he stepped
on a land-mine, so they buried what was left of him and marked his grave with cross with the words "Buenos Dias, Amigo.
R.I.P. Mayor Pedros" on it, near the jail. The Rangers left the jail, with ANOTHER kick-butt commando on their side.
They decided they’d skip killing the Scorpitron for now until they found some better gear. Being the one with the
near-insane ideas, Vince decided that they should go blast the Citadel Monks into fine red paste with all the LAWs
and RPG-7’s they had found in Las Vegas. So they set out once more back to the Citadel.

<P>---------------------</P>

"What the hell....? Christina disbanded!!" Anthony growled, noticing her corpse wasn’t
even amungst the dead in the main gates of the Citadel. Their newly-acquired commando
Covenant had the wicked accuracy with a spear that tore the Cit-Scum apart way before
Vince’s AK-97 (his rifle broke when he used it as a melee weapon against a Cyborg Commando
before they left, so he bought an AK-97), or the rest of the squad’s NATO’s even tickled
the monks.  Covenant had just laid waste to some monks swiftly an accurately....with three
$35 spears.
<P>
"Hmm....  I’m kinda messed up...." Vince said, looking over to another new teammate,
Dr. Mike Scott. His doctoring skills surpassed Vince’s in almost every way, so
Anthony took him along in case Vince got wasted. The squad also was wearing something
new; each of them decked out in Kevlar Suits. While they were shopping, the Anti-Muties
dropped by Darwin to pick up some supplies: such as Kevlar Suits, some more rockets,
and an AK-97 for Vince.
<P>
"Don’t worry. I’ll patch you up, Brother Vince." Mike Scott responded, pulling out his
medical bag.
<P>
"Stop calling me Brother Vince! I’m not part of your nut-case ‘Shroomer cultist buddies!"
Vince growled as the doctor began to tend to his wounds.
<P>
After going back to Quartz to pick up some more supplies, the Anti-Muties had replenished
their ammunition, and went back to the Citadel. Anthony was still peeved at Christina’s
cowardace. Maybe she just had urgent matters, like that idiot Jax Yllwhatever she kept
rambling about in her sleep. He wondered why he was so important anyway.  And what the
hell is "CLONE" supposed to mean? Anthony was sitting on the corpse of Brother Goliath
when his brother strolled over to him.
<P>
"Hey.  Check it out.  I figured out a way in. See those walls over there?" Vince smirked
as he pointed to some walls.  Waving his hand, Tachikawa pressed the detonator for the
TNT and sent a large portion of the wall into a pile of smoldering rubble. Anthony grinned
in delight.
<P>
"Lets go...." is all Anthony said as he picked up his RPG-7.

<P>----------</P>

The peace-loving Dr. Mike Scott lay slaughtered at Brother Akira’s feet. Three other
Brothers lay butchered at Vince’s feet, while the Rangers lay unconcious and others
seriously wounded. Akira chuckled, cracking his knuckles.  "You may have killed some of
my brethren, but you’re going to die, and so is the rest of your pathetic squad."
Vince clutched a smoking Meson<sup>TM</sup> cannon, the weapon he used to turn three monks
into unrecognizable piles of gore.
<p>
Ace stirred, awakening from his dream of partying in Downtown Needles with several
big-breasted babes all while knocking back Kamikaze’s. Noticing he was injured and
Vince was in trouble, he slowly took something from his belt: a LAW Rocket.
He picked up Anthony’s NATO and fired off a shot at the ceiling, bouncing it off an
angled beam in the ceiling and landing it right into Brother Akira’s left foot, blowing
through his sandal. The monk let out a yelp. Truly a lucky shot delivered
by one of the luckiest wasteland-dwelling soldiers alive.
<P>
"V! CATCH!" the constant-partier yelled as he chucked the LAW Rocket to Vince. The
Ranger intercepted it, lowering the empty Meson Cannon and levelling the rocket-gun at
the distracted Brother Akira.
<P>
"We might die, but I know for a fact you’re going to first. See you in hell,
Cit-Scum!!!" Vince yelled as he squeezed the trigger on the LAW Rocket. Brother Akira let
out a scream of horrified agony as the rocket landed directly in his stomach,
detonating inside of him and blowing him in half. His head got lodged in the ceiling, his
intestines dangling from his abdomen in thick heavy clumps while his legs lay twitching
on the ground. Vince dedicated the shot to Dr. Mike Scott. He
then rushed over to his seriously-wounded brother, Anthony, and began to patch him up
immediately. "Thanks, Ace."
<P>
Ace smirked and went back to dreaming.

<P>-----------------</P>

After they went back to town, they decided to check out Darwin. Oblivious that it was a
cloning project, they went about their merry way, buying AK-97s and more ammunition, until
they came across the two sick people. Using his high IQ, and doctor skill, he made a handy
little Anti-Toxin from a test-tube, Rattlesnake Venom,and Nuke-Avacados. Kind of made Vince
feel like McGuyver.
<P>
Bringing the two back into good health, Blackwolf, Tachikawa, Vince, and Anthony were
standing before the bad-ass Mexicans, Metal Maniac and Mad Dog Fargo. Grateful for helping
them recover from their illness, Mad Dog and Metal remained in the bar while the Rangers
left.
<P>
Covenant was becoming more of a bad-ass now, and had taken up cleaving enemies to death
with a chainsaw. Pretty messy, and it amused the rest of the Rangers when a Wasteland
Warrior was chopped into two halves. Ultimately, the Rangers returned to Las Vegas to
finish what Ace had gotten them into. Assassination, Cultists, BioDroids, and robot
Death-Machines all thanks to the luckiest man alive, Ace. Maybe with Vince’s newly
acquired Meson Cannon, they could turn that Scorpitron into scrap-metal.

<P>-------------------</P>

<P>The empty power-pack clattered the ground, smoking. Vince stood there, clutching
the Meson Cannon while Tachikawa let out a victory-cry, Blackwolf patted him on the back,
Anthony and Ace just laughed, and Covenant smirked. Vince had just blown the Scorpitron
into fragments before it could even get a lock on one of the squad. He was beginning to
like his Meson Cannon, despite its low ammo-capacity.
<P>
"YEAH! YOU JUST SMASHED SOMETHING IN TWO SECONDS THAT TOOK US TWO WEEKS! HA HA!!" Tachikawa
busted out. He could barely hold his liberated Laser-Rifle he was laughing so hard.  The
funniest part was that none of the Rangers had gotten killed, maimed, or injured in the
slightest way. Except for Anthony, who nearly got blown up by a stray Scorpitron blast
but barely dodged it, everyone was just dandy. The Anti-Muties showed their firepower in
a display that just about everybody saw or heard.
<P>
It was time to talk to Faran Brygo.

<P>--------------------</P>

<p>
Seems like the Rangers decided to postpone assassinating Faran for awhile, until they got
their reward for rescuing that cyborg guy Max. Now they were in the sewers, knee-deep in
murky sewage. Luckilly their kevlar-suits were pretty resistant to most of the cyborgs’
attacks. Vince had slung his Meson Cannon over his shoulder; he thought he’d save his
power-packs until he needed them,like storming the Citadel again. In his hand was his
trusty AK-97 "Mutie Slayer," the perfect anti-thug device, since ammo was common and
stores stocked clips by the dozens.
<P>
Several Tronodiles came busting out, firing their weapons en masse. The Rangers retaliated
by Tachikawa’s well-placed laser shot, which blew one of them up with a single blast to
the servoes, Blackwolf’s AK-97 blairing, Covenant’s Proton-Ax cleaving through the cyborgs
in a brutal matter, Anthony letting loose with his NATO, Vince sending a series of bursts
towards cyborgs, and Ace pumping out shots as fast as full-auto would let him. The squad
of seven Tronodiles was soon cut down, all riddled with bullets and slash-marks.
<P>
"Heh...they don’t make killer androids like they used to," Ace remarked as he slapped a
fresh clip into his AK-97.
<P>
"I’ll say. But they’re so many of them; it's like fighting a wall when you’re in those
closed-in tunnels," Tachikawa replied, reading the "4" on the digital Ammo-Indicator on
the side of his Laser Rifle. He’d have to reload soon.
<P>
"Hmph. Thats why you use a weapon that knocks out a wall of them," Covenant grunted;
his burly arms and incredibly speed with a Proton Ax were living proof that big doesn’t
always mean slow.
<P>
"Quit talkin’ so loud!" Vince finally whisper/blurted. He gestured to the pack of
Boa-Tronstrictors ahead. "You want them to hear us---" Vince was cut off as a laser
flew past his face. Recoiling , he pressed against the wall as three more blasts
followed. The other Rangers were doing the same, some of them pressing against the
floor as well. The Boa-Tronstrictors did this for a few minutes until Covenant pulled
his wicked Anti-Tank weapon.....a SPEAR, from his back.
<P>
WHAM! The spear struck through the first one’s face, cracking its sensors open and
leaking the silicone-fluid all over the place as it let out a mechanic screach.
Tachikawa pointed his laser rifle at the writhing robot-snake and fired, one, two,
three, beams of energy into its head, leaving it a writhing coil of machine on the
ground until it finally ceased functioning. Taking careful aim, he popped his last
shot into the second one’s laser. The shot entered the barrel and exploded, taking
the android serpent up in flames. The Chinese terrorist showed his "Americahhn" friends
how to maim the hell out of what could’ve been your impending doom. Slapping another
Power-Pack in, Tachikawa stood there, smirking.
<P>
"Nice trick with the spear," Ace commented, as he opened a bottle of beer with Vince’s
shovel.
<P>"The warrior has placed his skill in his marksmanship. Excellent attack, Tachikawa."
Blackwolf nodded as he bowed his head to Tachikawa.
<P>
"Let’s go now. I’m getting tired of waiting around for these damn androids to shoot at
us," Anthony finally spoke up.

<P>------------------</P>

<P>
"One servo-motor short. The could-be android’s creation was stopped by ONE servo-motor.
Guess they would have to find the Killer Robots on their own, or find another servo motor
somewhere. Maybe they could grab one from the Citadel, or find another one in Spade’s
bar.

<P>------------------</P>

<P>
"After dropping by Darwin, Vince stumbled upon the art of cloning. Joking around, he put
his cloned genes into a jug and did the same with the others. Hiding the jugs, all except
his since he wanted to carry his with him, under a heavy floor plate so whatever mutie
scum that came across the place couldn’t infect their DNA or mess it up, the team
left and set out for Spade’s Bar, Las Vegas.

<P>------------------</P>

<P>
"Ace had just gotten his brains blown out by some butt-head bar-tender while they swept
the occupants clean from Spade’s bar. Raking the bar full of high-impact FMJ’s and laser-blasts,
Ace was leaning against the bar while the others were maiming the hell out of whatever
came their way. Casino gaurds spewed blood all over the place as AK-97 or M1989A1 fire
ripped through them like flechettes pierce a paper-bag. Gamblers, drunks, and prostitutes
exploded all over the place or got blown apart by laser-bursts. The Anti-Muties were going
great until the all-too-familiar sound of a MAC-17 was heard. Blackwolf spun around in time
to notice Ace’s headless body fall onto its knees before landing in a heap. Letting out a
cry of rage, Blackwolf emptied the rest of the clip into the ‘tender, literally turning his
head, kneck, left shoulder, and left arm into a red mist. The others turned around, gazing
at the scene.
<P>
"One dead Ace Maloney. What was left of a bartender clutching a smoking MAC-17. And one
crazed Apache warrior holding a white-hot M1989A1 N.A.T.O. with a plume of smoke flowing
from the heated barrel. Anthony muttered, rubbing his head in wondering what to do. Out
of all the scummy recruits issued to him in his squad that got killed, he wished it wasn’t
Ace that had to go next. He regretted that it was his corpse laying dead on the floor.
<P>
Covenant sighed.  "Let’s bury’em. It seems his luck’s run out on him."  His words were
barely heard by Anthony as the others continued to tear the bar up with assault-rifles
or laser-fire. As swiftly as they had entered, they left with death and pain in their
wake.

<P>-----------------------</P>

<P>
"The Rangers lay dead in the Citadel, the monks standing over them holding smoking weapons.
Anthony took three laser-beams to the chest, boring a hole straight through him. Three
dead Brothers lay at Anthony’s feet, where he had went ballistic with his fallen brother’s
Meson Cannon before he got shot. Blackwolf was in two pieces, for he had taken a SABOT
Rocket dead in the legs, separating them from the rest of his body. He was in agony for
several minutes before a monk finished him off. Tachikawa was victim of a backstab. A
Proton-Ax was lodged in the back of his skull, still crackling with energy as he lay
sprawled on the floor. Covenant was lucky enough to escape with a few bad injuries,
and his body was nowhere to be found. Vince was on the ground in the heap. His left
arm was severed from his body, and he had several gaping holes in his back. He had been
shot from behind with a deadly ION-Beamer, which bored through his Kevlar Suit with ease.
Here’s how it went.

<P>"Hmm... so far we’ve wiped out most of them," Anthony smirked, holding his Laser-Rifle.
He was pretty sure the next group was problably going to be easy to take on. As he opened
up the door, Vince took point and ran in first, in a serpentine manner. The others followed
him, guns at the ready, or in Covenant’s case, Proton Ax raised.
<P>
It all happened so fast.
<p>
Tachikawa let out a scream of agony as the Proton Ax sank into his head.
<P>
"SLIME SUCKERS!!!"  Spinning around, Vince blasted the attacker as Tachikawa’s corpse fell
over, a Meson blast sending the monk several feet backwards until he landed on his back, a
foot-in-diameter hole where he caught Brother Paul in the gut, which went straight through
him.
<P>"I FEAR NOT DEATH!!!" Blackwolf ran towards a group of  them that had just popped up
out from behind a few hidden passages. Covenant followed him, screaming a war-cry along
with his Apache comrade. Sensing impending danger, Blackwolf turned around suddenly and
shoved Covenant to the side....taking a SABOT Rocket meant for him.
<P>
"Covenant could only watch in horror as his friend was blown in two, his legs vaporized on
impact and his body flying forwards. "AAAAARGHHHH!!!" He screamed as he landed, his legs
only a memory as he skidded to a halt.
<P>
<B>BLAMMO!!! BLAMMO!! BLAMMO!!! BLAMMO!!</b>
<p>
Vince’s left arm flew off, landing at Anthony’s feet still clutching the still-smoking
Meson Cannon. A red digital "6" on the electronic Ammo-Counter<sup>TM</sup> on the
side of the gun, above the Power-Pack. Three more ION blasts tore holes in Vince as he
attempted to get a grenade from his Kevlar Suit. His suit open, the small plastic jug
rolled out of his chest-piece and down the hall. Miraculously, an RPG-7 blast sent the
durable jug completely out of the Citadel’s vicinity. Vince was slammed down by two more
blasts which tore some more huge-ass holes in his back. Seems the Cit-Scum and their
hi-tech weaponry had tore him a new ass-hole.
<P>
Anthony, watching his squad drop like flies, pried the Meson Cannon from the fingers of
the smoking arm and ran towards the group, in a delerium. He didn’t care anymore, since
they were all pointing LAWs at him as he went truckin’ towards them. Similar to an Olympic
Athlete leaping over a hurtle and running track, he leaped over and through explosions,
the Meson Cannon blairing away as it tore open monks’ armor as if it were alluminum foil
until finally, Brother Lucifer (a really bad guy who’ll play an important part in the next
story), took careful aim with his Laser-Rifle.
<P>
<B>ZZAP! ZZAP! ZZAP!</B>
<P>
Anthony now had a hole the size of a silver-dollar going straight through him, blasting
through his heart. The three beams had hit as one, inflicitng a bad wound, then making
it deeper, and then ripping a hole through him. Anthony fell backwards, clutching at the
air for something to hold onto to keep him up. Fingers clawing across the wall, they
scraped against it lightly as he landed with a thud.
<P>
The small jug, labelled:
