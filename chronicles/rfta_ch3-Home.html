<P>Chapter 3 - Home
<p>
Jarrek stood in the middle of the town, as it burned, helpless to do anything but simply watch. No matter how he tried, he couldn't move an inch.
<p>
There was something running about in the shadows, always just barely out of sight. He could hear it however, and the sound turned his stomach and made his knees feel weak. It was laughing a mad, maniacal laugh that sounded like metal grinding 
against metal. 
<p>
Suddenly somebody familiar stepped from one of the burning huts surrounding him. It was Joseph, a large and jagged chunk of metal protruding from his back just as he left him days ago.
<p>
"Why did you have to leave that day? You should have died with us." It was Joseph's voice, although his mouth wasn't moving.
<p>
Jarrek tried to move, to say something, but he was still frozen in place. All he could do was watch while his friend calmly picked up a large wooden beam and swung it down at him, connecting solidly with his temple. The world spun, and he fell to 
the ground.
<p>
He awoke with a jolt, sitting upright quickly. He soon came to regret it, as his temple throbbed with pain. Slowly he lied back down and shut his eyes against the bright sun. 
<p>
He tried to pull his thoughts together. Where was he? What had happened? He gingerly brought his hand up to touch his temple, finding a bandage there. 
<p>
He tried to sit up again but the throbbing in his head increased and he sank back down to the ground. 
<p>
Suddenly, it all came back to him.
<p>
Why wasn't he dead? A Horned Demon never just left its prey alive after attacking. He couldn't remember anything other than being slammed to the ground by the Demon, hitting his head on something and blacking out.
<p>
He attempted to sit up again, this time managing to prop himself semi-upright using his elbows. His head throbbed and he groaned.
<p>
He heard movement nearby and forced his eyes open, shielding them from the sun with his hand. A figure stepped in front of the sun, allowing Jarrek to get a look at him. It was hard to judge height while lying here, but it was obviously a man, 
wearing what looked to be some kind of military fatigue. 
<p>
"Well well, look who decided to wake up. You hit your head pretty hard back there. I'm not claiming to be an expert, but I think it'd be best if you lay back down." The man crouched by his side, giving Jarrek his first good look at the man's 
face.
<p>
"Who are you?" Jarrek asked, lying back down. "What the hell happened?"
<p>
"My name's Loki. And you can count yourself as one of the luckiest men alive. I was walking along the rim of the arroyo back there a bit when I heard you shout. I went in that direction and saw you there, 'bout to get chewed up by one of those 
lizards. Just consider yourself lucky that it didn't decide to make a meal of ya right away, so that I had a chance to take a few shots at it." Loki shook his head slightly. "I think you have a concussion, so it's best if you don't move much. 
You've already been out for a day now,"
<p>
Jarrek wanted to ask more questions, but he was slowly realizing how tired he really was.
<p>
"Once you can walk, I know a place I can take you somewhere that you should be okay. For now," Loki stood and crossed his arms, examining Jerrek. "I'd suggest sleeping."
<p>
Almost as soon as this was said, Jarrek drifted to sleep. He dreamt again about his village, this time burnt to the ground, and that same metallic laugh that haunted him far after his dream left him.
<p>
Loki sat on a rock nearby the sleeping form of Jarrek, alternating between watching him and inspecting his shotgun. Far from new, but at least it was well kept. Nothing compared to his SPAS-12 back home, but it was functional at the least. 
<p>
His gaze shifted back to the sleeping form laying on his bedroll. Jarrek shifted and moaned, reaching up to hold his hand over the bandage that Loki had applied a few hours earlier. Not a bad job, in his mind. Working as the head medic's assistant 
for all those years really had rubbed off on him.
<p>
With a sigh Loki stood and fed a few more pieces of dried wood into the small fire. Not only was he not going to be home early, he was going to be late. Quite late, if that guy didn't hurry up and recover. 
<p>
There always was the option of just leaving him... Loki shook his head and dismissed the idea quickly. Anybody that lucky must have a reason to live, he thought with a small smirk. 
<p>
He laid back on the ground and looked up at the stars. The night was nice and clear, fortunately there were no clouds around to hold in the heat, so the temperature was quite pleasant.
<p>
He wondered how everybody back home was doing. Jess had probably given birth to her baby already. When was the baby expected? He was pretty sure it was this week. He checked his watch for the date. August the 24th, 2164. He couldn't wait to get 
back home to hear the news. 
<p>
He still considered Jessica his kid sister, although she wasn't a kid anymore by any means. During her 22nd birthday back in November, she surprised everybody by announcing that her tests had turned out positive, and that her baby was due in 
mid-August. 
<p>
Although, technically, the population restrictions were still in place, the news was well received by everybody and the restrictions were soon removed. Hers would be the first, hopefully followed by many. 
<p>
In the months that followed, there were quite a few casualties from quite a few different reasons. Radiation sickness and disease had already taken their toll, and there wasn't a single person that didn't have a friend or relative that had died. 
They were a close-knit community, after all.
<p>
Almost worse than the disease or radiation were the strange animals that plagued them. Some were harmless, and some were dangerous in the extreme. The perimeter defenses were set up quickly, but many of the cold-blooded creatures had bodies that 
were almost exactly the same temperature as the air around them, so the laser turrets couldn't pick up their heat signatures and were rendered useless. It wasn't uncommon at all to find a corpse in the morning, usually mangled severely.
<p>
Things were grim, but they hadn't given up just yet. Throughout it all, Jessica maintained a quiet sense of calm and hopefulness, in the process becoming a symbol of their hope for the future. People often turned to her for advice or consolation 
when times got hard.
<p>
She'll make a good leader one-day, Loki thought to himself with a smile.
<p>
His thoughts were interrupted by a rustling coming from the bedroll on the other side of the small fire, followed by a low moan.
<p>
Loki got to his feet and walked over to the man, crouching down by his side.
<p>
"How are you feeling?" Loki asked, grabbing his canteen and unscrewing the top.
<p>
Jarrek lifted his hand to gingerly touch the bandage on his injured temple and opened his eyes. "Better..." His eyes drifted down to the canteen. "Thirsty though."
<p>
Loki offered Jarrek a hand and helped him into a sitting position, giving him the canteen. 
<p>
"Thanks." Jarrek said after he was done drinking, handing back the canteen. His head was still sore, but at least it wasn't throbbing as before.
<p>
"No problem." Loki replied, recapping the canteen. "You've been out for a while now. I was beginning to think that you were never gonna wake up. I think the worst of your concussion has passed. Why don't you try walking around a bit?"
<p>
Jarrek nodded and Loki helped him to his feet. His head throbbed a bit when he moved, but he was more or less steady.
<p>
"Okay?" Loki asked.
<p>
"Yeah, I'm fine." Jarrek replied, taking a few steps and looking about. It was the same arroyo that he'd been in before being attacked by the Horned Demon.
<p>
"Glad to hear it. Do you think that you're good enough to travel?"
<p>
"Yeah, I think so." Jarrek said.
<p>
"Good," Loki replied, "then let's leave in the morning. I have to make up for some lost time. People back home are probably worrying about me by now."
<p>
Jarrek nodded his head. "What was your name again?"
<p>
"It's Loki. Actually, it's Mark Bergin, but only my parents call me that anymore."
<p>
"Why Loki?"
<p>
"Well, as a kid I had a bit of a mischievous reputation." Loki shrugged. "Somebody called me that once and it just stuck."
<p>
"Mine's Jarrek... Um, I don't have a last name though. Or a nickname, though most people just call me Jer."
<p>
"Sure thing, Jer. I went ahead and cooked up that lizard that almost ate you earlier. It's not that bad, although I have had better. Care to try some?"
<p>
Introductions out of the way, they both sat down and ate the bitter-tasting meat. After they finished, Loki extinguished the fire and set out his bedroll. 
<p>
"We're going to leave at first light," Loki said. "So you'd better get some sleep."
<p>
Jarrek nodded assent and climbed into his bedroll. It didn't take him long to fall asleep, but his dreams were haunted again by the same maniacal laugh
<p>
<p>
The travel over the next few days was hard, but Jarrek didn't take much note. His thoughts were instead of his departed family and friends.
<p>
Slowly, he was working things out in his mind, finally coming to terms with reality. He'd always considered himself a strong person, emotionally, and this only proved it to him. He would mourn them, but he would remain thankful that he had lived.
<p>
Him and Loki chatted a bit during their travel, but for the most part, they were silent except for the sound of their footsteps on the soft and eroded soil.
<p>
Loki talked a bit about his home after being told the story about Jerrek's village, but seemed oddly reluctant to explain certain details. Jerrek didn't press the issue, already having plenty on his mind.
<p>
After almost 4 full days of travel, they reached their final destination. At first all Jerrek could see was a small nook, surrounded on three sides by sheer cliffs, but as they neared, he began to pick out a small cluster of buildings.
<p>
As they were almost upon it, Jerrek could see now that a chain-link fence surrounded it, with the occasional pieces of odd-looking machinery placed a few meters away from the perimeter. 
<p>
"Jerrek," said Loki, "There's something that I should tell you about this place first..."
<p>
Loki stopped as he noticed a small entourage of people approaching from the city. He gave a slight shake of his head and a sigh.
<p>
"It doesn't matter. You'll find out soon enough." Loki said, leaving Jerrek to stand there with a look of puzzlement on his face.
<p>
The group of people approached, and soon he was able to see that it was made up of one woman walking in front, followed closely by about three men and two women. They were all smiling, he realized with a good bit of relief.
<p>
The lead woman's skin was a tad bit paler than most people from his village were, and indeed lighter than his own. Now that he thought about it, they all had rather pale skin, with the exception of Loki. 
<p>
"Loki," said the woman, "I'm glad that you made it back. Some of us were beginning to worry about you." She grinned. "But not me of course. I know you always come back."
<p>
Loki grinned and gave her a quick and friendly embrace. "Well, I couldn't let you all down now, could I?"
<p>
Jerrek watched as Loki continued as such down the line, exchanging pleasantries with each. Each of the people were wearing some type of fatigues, something like what Loki was wearing, only full suits instead of combinations. They were made out of a 
material with a tan colored camouflage print that blended in well with the surroundings.
<p>
"Jerrek," Loki said, "This is our Overseer, Raisa."
<p>
Raisa gave him an appraising look, the corner of her mouth turned up in a slight grin. Jarrek couldn't quite help noticing that she really was quite good looking, despite the loose fitting fatigues that she wore.
<p>
He realized that he was gawking a bit, and coughed. "Oh, sorry... It's good to meet you, Raisa." He stammered out.
<p>
She grinned a bit more at that and extended her hand which he gave a quick shake. "The pleasure's all mine." She turned to Loki at this and raised an eyebrow. "Now, Loki, you know the policy about bringing outsiders here. Just how exactly did he 
end up here with you?"
<p>
"Well," Loki said, "It's a bit of a long story... Maybe we can talk about it over dinner. I'm famished."
<p>
Raisa turned to give him the same look as before, and Jerrek couldn't help but think that he was being slowly dissected and studied. "Very well." She said at last, turning back and walking towards the cluster of buildings. "But tell him that he'd 
better behave."
