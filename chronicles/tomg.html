<P>
In the beginning, there was not much to the universe.  Just a
couple of flickering pin pricks in the blackness of space.  And
then, much later, say, after a couple gazillion years (plus or
minus a few picoseconds), there existed a little town called
Needles where this old hobbled man who loved to cheat at playing
poker resided.  Unfortunately for him, today, a couple gazillion
years after the beginning of the universe, somebody was about to
catch him.  Today just wasn't going to be his day. . . .

<p>
Certainly not like three days ago at about three in the
afternoon, when he had happened to notice a penny lying face up in
the street, and then, upon bending down to give it closer inspection, 
had just barely missed a would-be fatal collision with a
stray machine gun bullet which had been fired from the gun of his
senile next door neighbor by his senile next door neighbor who was
hunting ``that darned infernal killer flea'' that had ``scourged the
neighborhood for the last time.''  Yes, that had been this old man's
day; for, when he stood up, he realized that it was not a penny at
all, but rather a corroded and squashed dime.  He'd just received
a nine cent bonus and saved his own life, all in a matter of five
seconds!

<p>
But, unfortunately, things weren't going to work out just as
well today for Mr. Grizzly, as his friends liked to call him,
partly because his voice was so grumpy and he angered easily, but
mostly because he didn't remind them too much of a donkey--and it
would have been silly to call him Mr. Wilbur.  Mr. Grizzly sat
there in the Party-Hard Barn dealing out the tattered remains of
the last deck of cards in town--they didn't make cards anymore in
Needles, especially since that last misfired mortar slammed into the
card shop down the street--to his two friends: Lumpy, and that
other guy he'd been friends with for thirty years (but ``darn it!''
couldn't for the life of him remember the old geezer's name).

<p>
Across the table, Lumpy looked puzzled at the ace of spades in
his chunky hands, and immediately knew something was not quite right.

<p>
Mr. Grizzly stacked the un-dealt cards on the table in front
of him, and picked up his hand.  His clever deal had worked yet
again (or so he thought), and he smiled at a possibly lucrative
king, queen, jack, and ten of diamonds, plus the customary
trash-to-be-traded low scoring club card.  Lumpy had been remarking
for years at what a clever and consistent dealer Mr. Grizzly had
been, and once again, Mr. Grizzly thought he'd given Lumpy
something to talk about.  Indeed, Lumpy would be talking about this
day for a while.

<p>
Lumpy started the bet a little warily, shoving three small
half-polished marble shaped rocks--``rock duds,'' as d'Burns Jr. had
called them--to the center of the table.  The bank had been next to
the card factory (on Peydros Avenue--now The Peydros Memorial
Heavy-Water Park and Grill), and old-timers like Lumpy and his friends
whose retirement savings had gone the way of the decaying carbon-14 atom
with the bank-teller, Sy d'Burns, resorted to the polished
rock-marbles for money.

<p>
``Only three today, Lumpy?  What's the matter, dude, ya goin'
cheap on us?''  What's-his-name spoke up gruffly, snickering with
Mr. Grizzly.

<p>
Lumpy looked up from his peculiar complete-nothing-of-a-hand
and sighed.  ``Naw, I cain't seem to find my other two duds--
besides, I ain't got hulch!  Maybe I oughta fix that darned hole in
my shirt pocket.''

<p>
Lumpy had been saying that he ought to fix that darned hole in
his shirt pocket fixed for fifteen years.  It was his favorite
shirt, holes included, and because of the useless pockets, his
marble-currency seemed to find new places to collect lint rather
often.  It really didn't matter if Lumpy had the funds with which
to gamble, however, because he'd never been very good at it anyway. 
In fact, he'd not won a hand of water poker with these ``geezers''
(he called them) in five years.

<p>
``Guess the poor guy's finally lost his marbles,'' Mr. Grizzly 
matter-of-factly muttered to himself.

<p>
What's-his-name sat there staring at his hand of cards.  He
thought it odd that he didn't have the Ace of
Spades in his hand.  He looked up at Lumpy, who was, true to his
name, swallowing a lump the size of Texas (or what was left of it)
rather hard down his quickly drying throat.  Both of the old men
looked at Mr. Grizzly, who was smiling as usual.  Lumpy could tell
he was smiling through all that facial hair because when he smiled,
his moustache curled up into little twirls that reminded Lumpy of a
Ferris wheel, and wheel rhymes with spiel, and spiel mixed up
spells spile (as Mr. Grizzly was a little mixed up in the head),
and spile rhymes with smile.  As these best friends grew older,
they started to play crazy rhyming games while sitting out on the
front porch of the Party-Hard Barn.  ``Keeps you going,'' Lumpy
always said.  Unfortunately, it was too late to save his sanity,
but they had fun with it anyway.

<p>
Mr. Grizzly looked up at his nameless friend and snickered. 
``Well, ain'tcha gonna bet?'' he said with a smirk.

<p>
What's-his-name stood up and pushed his chair back, gasping in
shock at the five playing cards in his hand, and glared at Mr.
Grizzly.  ``Naw, I ain't gonna bet, dude.  You've messed up the
cards!''  He showed the cards to the dealer.  ``Yer a cheatin' rad
rat's hulch!  I told ya I was always supposed to get the ace of
spades!  Ya didn't deal it to me, dude!''  The exacerbated old man
threw down his cards and fumbled with the right pocket of his
age-old and over-flakked flak vest and pulled out a small metal
gray rectangular box.  Right arm extended, he pointed
the smooth metal object at Mr. Grizzly, looked out at his slightly
quivering outstretched arm, turned the contraption around and pointed it
again at the now trembling dealer.

<p>
Suddenly the background music stopped and the Party-Hard
Barn's patrons tensed.  Lumpy looked at his two friends and
clenched his teeth with worry.  Mr. Grizzly swallowed really hard
and very slowly, as if he were savoring the last bit of gum juice
from the last piece of Fargo's Radmint gum in all of New Nevada. 
What's-his-name just stood there, his visage one of complete
outrage.

<p>
Then, Mr. Grizzly finally recognized the contraption pointed at him. . . .

<p>
Out from nowhere sounded a characteristic ``Duhn Duhn Duhn!!''  He
he felt that if there were cameras recording this afternoon's events, 
they'd all be zoomed in on his startled expression.

<p>
Gasping loudly with a ``Doh!'', Mr. Grizzly suddenly remembered the
guy's name.  It was Maloney.  Ace Maloney.  He'd just unintentionally 
not dealt the ace of spades to Crazy Ace Maloney, and now. . .
Now he was going to pay.

<p>
``Well,'' Mr. Grizzly began, slowly and in a low growl, lower
than most of his words, ``ya got to me at last. . . .''  Mr. Grizzly
sounded like a battery-operated cassette player that was running on
over-used SuperVolts.  ``Go. . . ahead. . . .  Shoot. . . me. . .
Ace. . . Maloney. . . .''

<p>
Those words were the last that anyone ever heard Mr. Grizzly
say.  Mr. Grizzly didn't die from a laser shot, but not because Ace
didn't shoot the laser derringer at him.  The power cell had run out of
power about forty years ago; all it did now was squirt water
and make funny gurgling noises.  Mr. Grizzly didn't die from the
fifteen minute water gun fight that ensued, either.  And, strangely
enough, Mr. Grizzly didn't die because he was ninety-nine years
old.

<p>
They buried his respectable pile of rock duds with him, and
etched on his gravestone:

<h4>
<center>Here lays Mr. Grizzly<br>
2007-2037<br>
Petered out at the ripe ol' age<br>
of 99 (30 human years)<br>
'cause his brain was full.<br>
</center>
</h4>

<P>
Ace looked up from the slightly glowing red sand wisping off the
freshly filled grave to face the crowd seated on borrowed Party-Hard
Barn chairs.
Lumpy sat straight and solemn, trying to hide a six-pack
of Ace-House Brew behind his spindly legs.  Beside him sat Sy d'Burns
Jr., wishing he hadn't missed the poker game.  And, sitting next to
him was Mr. Grizzly (with features polished, joints oiled, and fitted with
a newly assembled brain-unit Ace had been tinkering around with).

<P>
Ace cleared his throat and finished Mr. Grizzly's eulogy.
``Actually, not a bad way to go, dudes.  Those first generation
android brain units could only remember so much before their
batteries just went ka-plooie!  Heh heh!''
