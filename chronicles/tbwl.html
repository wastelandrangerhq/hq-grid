<strong>Chapter T-Minus One and Counting<br>
Past is Prologue:  Department of Defense, U.S.A, Spring 1991</strong>
<p> 
"Hey, Grimsly, you know why Iraqi tanks have rear view mirrors?"
<p>
A rather annoyed Kelsey Grimsly looked up from his computer terminal in the
Department of Defense.  He was currently trying to make a cross analysis
of General Norman Schwarzkopf's Desert Storm strategies in comparison with
the battle strategies the general had executed in other combat arenas.
"I really do not know, Mr. Dymes, and I really do not care."
<P>
"So they can watch the battle!  Get it?  They're retreating and
stuff?  Oh forget it."  Bob Dymes resigned himself to the fact that the
only one in his office with a sense of humor was himself.
Unless you count the paper shredder which had just
shredded some vital documents of Kelsey's--by accident, of course.
<p>
Bob turned back to his computer screen, which was a map of Kuwait
and all the burning oil wells Hussein had ignited.  He was supposed to 
determine the most efficient and expedient route for clean up.  He pressed
a series of buttons, and to his delight, Super Tetris came back to the
screen.
"I love what you can do with computers these days," Bob thought to himself,
as he began work on completing his 102nd line.
<p>
Suddenly, the computer screen flickered, then went blank.  A red
wave of guilt washed over his face.  "Oh great, now what've I done!" he
muttered.
A nervous glance in his office-mate's direction indicated that his monitor
had also blinked off. 
Bob thought he heard a small rumbling and glanced over at the file server
housed against the wall.
<p>
Kelsey Grimsly narrowed his eyes at Bob, also known as Eclipse Bob,
since he often crashed the entire network of SUN computers.  Bob
lumbered over to
the ominously large file server to investigate the noise, opened the
locked metallic sliding doors housing the IC boards, and peered in.
<p>
Inside, everything looked absolutely normal to Eclipse Bob.  A microscopic
scanning of the hardware and peripheral equipment would reveal
otherwise, but Bob would have never guessed to order one of those.
He shrugged his shoulders at
Kelsey and was acknowledged by an exasperated Grimsly Grunt, and then he
crawled
back to his desk, vowing to erase Super Tetris off his hard drive--after
he cleared a few more lines.
<p>
"Awww c'mon!  Who erased my high score in Super Tetris??"
<p>
Soon Bob and Kelsey were absorbed in their work, but little did they realize
that on the almost-microscopic level, a battle had been waged inside the
guts of the SUN file server, and a virus had just been removed from the
system, thanks to the anti-virus program.  As the dust cleared, the
anti-virus program merge-sorted through the rubble.
All that was left of its virus prey was its potent weaponry code.
<p>
A binary bit stream sped to the massive SUN's CPU: "Virus 3D6A
Neutralized.  Query: Incorporate Weapon?"
<p>
"NEGATIVE.  RETURN FOR REPAIR PATCHES."
<hr> 
Jax Yllandian and Taran Cyberpunk kept running through the strange maze
of blinking lights, tall bare rectangular metallic trees, and gold
pathways until Jax was out of breath, and they stopped behind a towering
green wall crisscrossed with
highlights in gold.  Victory had eluded them this time, but they had in
turn eluded those nasty tanks.
<p>
"You still functioning, Jax?" Taran inquired with a slight metallic accent.
<p>
"I'll live, T," Jax said between gasps, and piercing glances over his
shoulder.
<p>
Taran snapped open a circuit patch on his left arm and started
re-calibrating his motor neurons.  "Good thing they like Ion Beamers, eh?"
the half-Ranger, half- machine quipped between precisely regulated breaths.
<p>
It took Jax a minute to catch his breath after their taxing retreat.
"Yeah. . . but now we're. . . weaponless in terra incognito. . . .
I wonder if this place has a library.  Let's go, T."
<p>
"Right behind you Jax."

<strong>Introduction</strong>
<p>
What follows is another Wasteland <font size=1>TM</font>
Trek instigated by actual happenings
in the life of Maestro Bernard Assaf, brother of Maestro David Assaf.  Those
readers expecting a similar story to Tales From the Wasteland<font size=1>
TM</font> (c.f) are
in for a shock, for
this story is shockingly un-similar to Part One in the ongoing saga of
the Wasteland <font size=1>TM</font> Treks.  The authors have noted the negative response to
the harsh language spoken
by several cast members of the last story; the actors have been sacked.
The new actors are aware of the strict rules on the use of such language.

<strong>Chapter Zero<br>
Escape to Time:  Earth, Fall 1991</strong>
 
"Hey, What's up?"  Ben greeted his acquaintance with forced
enthusiasm.  He did not like to be interrupted while he was playing his
favorite
computer game.  He made a mental note of his characters' situation,
("Hold on, guys...") and stood up politely to greet his guest, who let
herself in at Ben's bidding.
<p>
"Yeah, is Scott around?"  (Ben knew what she wanted before she even asked.) 
"I was about to go eat and wanted to know if he -- [blush] <i>ya'll</i>
wanted to come along."
<p>
"What are you blind???  Of course he's not here!  Can't you open your
eyes???" Ben THOUGHT.  "No, Scott went to go take some pictures. . ."
<p>

<strong>Move to Fall 1998:</strong>
<p>
Ben rambled on, making light but minimal-brain-powered-conversation; Napalm
looked up from the CRT connected to Ben's computer and sighed.  "Man, I
HATE when he does that!!!  Just 'cause our watches don't move no more, and
we can't do nothing except fart an' unjam our weapons, doesn't mean we're
on hold! Goshdarnit!  I get sooo impatient when--"
<p>
"Napalm, give me a break.  You fly off the handle every time he does that.
It gets old after a while."  Dr. Who, the team intelligentsia, reprimanded
Napalm.  "All brawn and no brains," thought Dr. Who, whose I.Q. rating of 23
almost tripled Napalm's.  "Just use this time to polish Excalibur."
<p>
Napalm was a great fighter, and
had his moments of intellectual inspiration, but they were few and far
between.  Kinda like the five or six hairs on Mayor Peydros' head.
<p>
Dr. Who made a slight exhalation of discontent and busied himself
with Dr. Who business.  After all, somebody had to do it. 
Today's business included wondering if
Napalm could actually polish his knife without Ben's command.  You see,
the party always took direct orders from Ben, but clearly, Ben was not
commanding him to think, and maybe, just maybe, given this fact, he could
prove that the Rangers were not, after all, just puppets in the radioactive
sand. 
<p>
So that's why Dr.  Who devised
this ingenious plan to egg Napalm on to polish his blade.  He didn't
like to think they
were controlled, for although they had their own will, Ben basically
instructed them however he wanted.
<p>
Stinging with contempt at Dr. Who's insult, Napalm immediately reached for
his blade, and nearly decided that Dr. Who needed a new haircut.  He flicked
it around with his deft fingers, the 30.48 centimeter blade whistling
happily with cold deadliness.  "Idiot...."
<p>
Napalm.  What a guy.  Excalibur.  What a knife.  Ordinary in every respect,
but in Napalm's hands, a true radioactive vermin and punk carver.  Napalm
had christened his 30.48 centimeter blade "Excalibur" after creating his
first road pizza. 
<p>
Napalm tensed his bulging muscles, withdrew Excalibur, and polished it
to a sheen brighter than the reflection of the hot desert sun off Mayor
Peydros' balding head. 
<p>
But let's stop making fun of poor Mayor Peydros.  After all, the poor
guy's wife is dead--Napalm accidently cut the blue (no, yell -- Aaaaaahhhh!)
wire on the bomb that had grown attached to his wife.  Poor Mr. Peydros--
they just released him from ten years of jail, and he's going to die soon
anyway.
<p>
Napalm scanned again the great big CRT in the sky.  Ben was still
chattin' away with his friend, who was likewise still chattin' away with
Ben.  Suddenly, Napalm grimaced.
<p>
"Yo, 'Who-man!" he yelled anxiously.  The rest of the team looked up,
following Napalm's line of sight.  Ben was moving back to his computer.
Christina perceived Ben's motion toward his computer as his intention to
continue playing.  So, she closed her eyes and while she mentally
prepared herself for some vermin-kicking, she dropped her gear and Uzi
and began to do some push- ups for a warm up.  However, the others (that
is, Napalm, Dr. Who, and the rest--
Mandarin, a Chinese woman with quick and skilled fingers and the most
dexterous of the group; Pretty Boy, the demolitions, anti-tank and
safecrack expert; Mayor Pedros,
the middle-aged Mexican mayor of New Nevada, whose days were numbered;
and Ace,
the party-dude (party, dude!) who could only have survived this long by
luck--were not so hasty as to prepare themselves in Christina's manner.
Unfortunately, Christina's preparation would be her undoing.
<p>
Dr. Who, in a burst of extreme smartness, perceived beyond what everyone
(except Christina) saw.  While each was eager for continued action,
(Christina more so), Dr. Who realized that Ben was reaching for the power
switch to his computer.  Dr.
Who understood that with the flip of this switch, they would go into a
state of computer hibernation, until recalled again to action.
"Oh, the life of
a saved game of Wasteland <font size=1>TM</font> characters," he thought.
<p>Then, in the timeless seconds during which Ben was reaching for the power
button, Dr. Who realized that the user who called the Rangers into
existence had forgotten to save the game!
<p>
Conclusion 1: "We must get out of here!"  A second
realization came to his multi-processing brain a split-second later:
Napalm had successfully polished Excalibur without Ben's consent!
<p>
Conclusion 2: "We can't wait for Ben to tell us to blow this joint!"
<p>
A sudden wind whipped through the ranks of the party, and brought
Dr. Who's attention to something he had never seen before: a black hole
in the ground, partially
covered and cleverly hidden by a dune of sand!  Dr. Who yanked Napalm
and bolted
for the hole.  Napalm realized the urgency, and with his most commanding
and fearsome voice, the giant warrior shouted, "Haul Asphalt Rangers!"
<p>
Pretty Boy without question rushed after Napalm in Dr. Who's direction.
The Chinese woman quickly passed up Pretty Boy and Napalm, and followed Dr.
Who who had made a flying leap into the hole.  Napalm still didn't clearly
grasp the whole situation (one can't grasp much with an 8 I.Q. and a name like
"Napalm") but he knew
that everything the Doc did was thought out.  He'd never been wrong,
either.  Mayor Pedros also followed his rescuers, and Ace brought up the
rear, as he had always done, being last in the marching order.  The
Rangers felt safe with Ace guarding their rears.
<p>
It was only then that Christina snapped out of her pre-battle warm-up.
It was too late, for as she sat up, she saw Ace calling back to her as he
ran full speed semi-backwards, in order to see her, toward the strange
black hole into which Dr. Who had
just jumped.  Ace was fond of Christina, for although she spit too much
and usually
ended up taking his ammo because she loved to "burn" full clips, she
possessed a
very courageous will to live which Ace admired.  Maybe it was that which
nearly compelled him to turn around and wait for her.
<p>
The Big CRT in the sky began a final closure, and the world began to grow
dim. Seeing this, and now aware of her impending doom, but slightly angry
at Napalm
because he was always ordering her around, Christina scrambled on her
feet intent on giving him a piece of her mind: "Man, I intend on givin'
Napalm a piece of my mind!"
<p>
More importantly she was intent on saving her own life.  "Man, I
am more intent on savin' my own life!"  Halfway to the hole, she spied
Pretty Boy's arms and assault
rifle as he dove into the hole, arms flailing.  She saw Ace stop to help
the Mayor's
descent, and he looked back concerned at Christina, who was now trucking
it full speed toward her companions.
<p>
"Hurry, Christina!!!!!" Ace begged at the top of his lungs, as he
fumbled with
his backpack.  She approached within ten feet of the pitch black hole,
which had
seemingly swallowed her fellow Rangers, and Christina realized she had
left her Uzi
behind.  She balked for only a second just yards away from the edge of
the hole as
she contemplated whether to turn back for her precious gun.
<p>
"Chris!!!!" Ace shouted once more as he dangled from the edge of the hole by
his fingertips.  In his left hand he held a hook, and he tried to clamp
it over the edge
quickly, for his grasp was slipping.  Just as it dug into the sand, it
caught on a
metallic rim surrounding the perimeter of the hole.  He perched on a
knot tied in the
rope attached to his grapple, and looked up expectantly.  The shadow of
Christina's
body covered him in the final waning sunlight.
<p>
Christina realized the stupidity of weighing her gun over her life, and she
made one last brave and valiant lunge toward the hole.  In the same
swift movement,
as she realized that she would die for some strange reason she could not
comprehend,
she reached for the one thing which she valued more than her life, (and
even her Uzi) and she hurled it into the hole.  "AAAAAAaaaaacceeee!!!"
<p>
In that second, although Christina's watch hands did not move,
time seemed to
jump forward several millennium but stand still at the same time, as the
CRT finally
closed up with a flash of blue electricity, sending bolts of energy
throughout the tired, ravaged desert.  Sounded something like. . .
<p>
<strong>"KABLOOOOOOIEEEEE-KABLAMATA-MOOOOO!!!!  (crackle crackle crackle)
PKKK-TAU-TAU-TAU.</strong>  Pkkk-tau-tau-tau."
<p>
The soft red glow of the radioactive Wasteland<font size=1>TM</font> sand,
now the only source of
light in the world, provided no comfort for Christina, who lay on the
harsh burning
dune, her fingers clutching fistfuls of hot sand only centimeters away
from the hole,
a twisted look of pain scrawled upon her face, and a solitary tear
frozen half way down her cheek.

<hr>
<strong>Chapter One<br>
The Middle: Terra/Tempus Incognito (moments before the end of Chapter
Zero)</strong>
<p>
The world seemed to flicker.  Pretty Boy glanced up as he dove
into the hole. 
He saw the big CRT in the sky flicker with blackness, and saw the first
of the
lightning bolts shoot outward.  They scattered madly in all directions,
scoring the
skies with a protesting fury and intensity as would be expected if Mars
himself had
been pounding the dome of the heavens with his proton axe.  He felt his
heart flutter
as he passed underground.  But what he expected to be underground -- a
moist, dimly lit cave perhaps -- was by far not what he experienced.
He felt as if he were in the middle between two worlds.
One which he had known since his birth, and
another beyond all his comprehension.  A big head rush soon followed as
he fell for
almost twenty or thirty feet, sliding on his back against some slick tube.
<p>
Pretty Boy became scared.  He clutched onto his AK97 with a grip of fear.
A faint scream escaped his lips as he felt the afternoon's lunch of
roasted rad' rat creep up his esophagus.  Then unexpectedly, without
warning, and taking Pretty Boy completely by surprise, his mass met a
second solid mass, and as two corporeal
masses cannot occupy the same space at the same time, Pretty Boy's atoms
winced with pain, being the unwilling recipients of too many joules of
kinetic energy.
<p>
But that other solid mass was breathing.  Moaning.
<p>
"Oooooh, man! Mmmmf!  You sure is (mmmff) heavy!  Must be all dose (mmmff)
manglers you been packin'," Napalm managed to get out as soon as he unburied
his mouth from underneath Pretty Boy's combat boots.
<p>
"Well look out, if you can, Nape.  Ace, the Mayor, and Christina were
behind me!" the movie star-turned-Ranger admonished, as he re-swallowed
his lunch,
and shook his head from queasiness, tweetie-birds, and a case of
Completely Heinous
Response Implicating Systematic Total Momentum Absorption Syndrome 
(CHRISTMAS).
<p>
They both looked up, but couldn't see a thing.  Darkness swallowed every trace
of light.  (There's no TRACE of it!)  The "ground" on which they rested
was distorted with curves and was tactually rubbery, and appeared to give 
slightly.
<p>
"Hey, Nape, where's the Doc and Mandarin?" Pretty Boy queried apprehensively.
<p>
"I don't know, man, I --"
<p>
"Look out below Hombres!!!" screamed a terrified and fast approaching
Mayor.
<p>
Napalm and Pretty Boy looked at each other in darkness: "Ohhh sh--"
<p>
Their voices were cut off as the massive mayor mistook them for a
trapeze- artist safety net.  Needless to say, he was the camel that broke
the straw's back.  Napalm and Pretty Boy felt the surface below them give 
way to the Mayor's weight, and down they went again, to a chorus of 
"AAAAAAAaaaaaaaaaaahhhh!!!!!!!" and the aforementioned "Kablamatamo," 
which coincidentally happened at the same time.
<p> 
<strong>Meanwhile, above:</strong>
<p>
Ace shut his eyes and drew his head down, as the world above him shook and
exploded with deafening roar and brilliant lightning flashes.  From his
precarious
perch, hanging by rope and grappling hook, he slowly opened his eyes,
but could see
nothing below him.  Although he had learned to trust his rescuers, he
did not trust
the strange blackness into which he had plunged.
<p>
He unclenched his fist and glanced at the object Christina had hurled at 
him, which he had luckily caught.  (If the universe were a role-playing 
universe, Ace would have a very high LUCK score of, say, a 19.  
Unfortunately, his "hypothetical" I.Q. score was not as high, and the small
rectangular grey metal contraption meant nothing to him.)  He looked up
once more, waiting for Christina to appear.
<p>
Still nothing.  Ace adjusted his weight and shimmied up his rope slowly.  
Above him he could hear nothing but a shrill wind, and he saw
red sand being blown everywhere.  Some flew down the shaft into his face
and he clenched his eyes shut.
<p>
"Aww, man!  I just had my contacts cleaned last week!!!  Chris? Hey,
where are you?  Man, you better get down here, or you'll miss my next
party!  Chris?  CHRIS??"
<p>
Ace grew frantic.  He shoved Christina's gadget in his flak vest pocket, and
attempted to climb out of the hole.  Before he reached the surface, he
found that he could not breach an invisible barrier that had suddenly 
interrupted the flow of sand into his face, and obscured his vision just 
when his visual cortex had registered the
picture of a humanoid hand spread flat against the barrier.  Christina
was trapped outside!  Ace blindly bashed the force field above his head 
with all his might, but to no avail.  He only succeeded in jarring the 
grappling hook loose, much to his dismay.
<p>
"Awwwwww FRrrrraaakkk!!!"
<hr>
Halfway down the modem wire, in the supra-normal sonic frequencies, a faint
"Christinaaaaaa..." was emitted from a broken-hearted Ranger....
<p>
<strong>A little while earlier:</strong>
<p> 
When the dust settled, it was Mandarin, the lightning-quick ninja-thief, who
bounced right back on her feet with a triple-somersault back flip ninja
kick (Ya-tah!) and surveyed the situation with hands raised like a true
Inspector Clouso.  They had fallen into a small metallic room, with no 
apparent discernable features except for a
dim light emanating from one wall.  Mandarin, with all her training in
the metals of war, knew that the metal comprising the room was of alien 
origin.
<p>
Her leader and longtime ally, the intelligent master medic, lay crumpled 
on the floor, writhing silently.  Dr. Who had temporarily paralyzed his 
abdominal muscles by the fall, and could not breathe.
<p>
"Doctor, you feel OK?" the Chinese woman spoke, laughing.  The poor American
hadn't fallen correctly.
<p>
"Uuuhggnnn!" Dr. Who managed to grunt dazedly.
<p>
"You had best move, Doc."  She dragged him over to the far wall, out from
underneath the hole in the ceiling from which they had fallen.
<p>
Napalm fell with a crunch as his great mass impacted the solid floor.
<p>
"Hmm.  Didn't even dent it!" Mandarin exclaimed.
<p>
Napalm rolled out of the way as Pretty Boy came sliding down the chute.  But
Napalm realized "He's got all the manglers!!!" and he quickly slid back
on his knees to cushion P.B.'s fall.
<p>
The Rangers' AT-weapons expert landed with an "OOoofff!" in Napalm's
generous arms.  Pretty Boy looked down.  "Hmmm.  Didn't even dent it!"
<p>
Luckily, none of the weapons detonated.  Mandarin, bringing Dr.
Who back to some semblance of his senses, let a sigh of relief slip by her
stoic lips.  She spied
Pretty Boy's bare belly as his shirt and vest had slid up his abdomen
with the slide. He was working on a small beer-gut.  "Man, Peanuts, you go
off your diet, or what??"
<p>
Napalm grinned at the flailing
arms of Pretty Boy, who was lost somewhere between Napalm's muscles and
his flak vest.  Pretty Boy let his rocket launchers drop from his body, and
slipped through Napalm's pectorals to cover the ground.
<p>
"Better peel him off the floor, and slide him over here before Ace
and Christina come!"  Mandarin reminded Napalm.
<p>
"Oh.  Yeah," and with a quick sweep of Napalm's right foot, Pretty Boy slid
into the Doctor and made him cough.
<p>
"Mandy, we. . . made. . . it?" the veteran medic gasped, half-conscious,
grasping Mandarin's flak vest.
<p>
"Doc?  Drake??" Mandarin whispered haltingly, staring wide-eyed at the
Doctor.  The doctor's grip loosened and he slipped into unconsciousness,
the fall having taken too much out of him.  Mandarin shielded the Doctor as a
loud scream increased above.
<p>
"Christiiiinnnnnnaaaa... Erchgg!!"  Ace dropped like a Rodan turd from the
tube.  He just lay there, shaking and breathing heavily, but breathing.
A trail of rope began to slide down after him.
<p>
Pretty Boy looked up from the ground and noticed Ace's wet face.  "Hey guys,
I think Ace took some flak up there, or something. . . ."
<p>
The battered Ace managed to pull himself together, lifted himself
up, and cried, "Napalm, Pretty Boy," he gasped.
<p>
"You OK little guy?" Napalm asked delicately.
<p>
"Christina..."
<p>
"Yeah, she'll be here any minute; she was right behind you, huh?"
<p>
"No, Christina..."
<p>
"Yeah?"
<p>
"She's--"
<p>
KONK!!!  A big, four pronged grappling hook attached to the rope slammed
into Ace's already bruised head, knocking him out.  Napalm could have 
sworn that he saw a few yellow birds circling Ace's head, just like in 
old 70's Saturday morning Road Runner cartoons (Napalm's favorites), but 
Pretty Boy corrected Nape's thoughts, saying he had the copyright on 
tweetie-birds, and that these were merely cheaply fashioned facsimiles.
<p>
Napalm knelt and examined Ace's head, fearing the worst.  He sighed with
relief, however, as he picked up the grapple.  "Hmmmm.  Didn't even dent
it!" he said as he patted Ace's head, which had become the center of a 
solar system of planets, moons, birds, and purple horseshoes.  Pretty Boy 
was visibly jealous at this masterful display of orbiting K.O. cartoons.
<p>
Mandarin cradled the prone head of Dr. Who, her expression metamorphosing
with silent realization.  "Christina. . . "

<hr>
<strong>Chapter Two<br>
The Citadel:  The Wasteland <font size=1>TM</font>, Fall 1998, minutes
before end of Chapter Zero</strong>
<p>
Citadel.  One of the most feared and respected outposts in all the
Wasteland <font size=1>TM</font>.  Inside the little red flags that 
demarcated danger on each side of the fortress,
anything was fair game.  Even the little ants that wandered past the
warning flags were susceptible to the harsh actions of the Brothers' sandles.
<p>
"All brethren, report to the main control-room immediately.  Drop
everything and report at once.  This is not a recording."
<p>
"Awww, man!!!" Brother Maynard sighed, as he put down his Nintendo game
boy.  It didn't work very well, and all he had was Tetris<font 
size=1>TM</font>, but it sure beat keeping constant watch over the 
ancient Holy HandGrenade.  He got up, and checking on the
'Grenade one more time, headed for the M.C.
<p>
"Awwww, man!!!" Brother Dave sighed, as he interrupted the song he was
broadcasting over UDED, 98.6, The Citadel.  "Well, folks, it looks like
I gotta go.  Big Brother is calling me!  Be sure to tune in later for 
more brainwashing and less songs on 'Vegas's favorite, 98.6, The 
Citadel!  This has been a Brother Dave production."  He pulled off his 
headphones, switched on the general brain-washing tape, and reported as 
called.
<p>
"Awwww, man, I mean, woman, I mean, awww, dude!" Brother Sister sighed,
confusedly.  "Like I'm coming, Ok?  Geee whiz.  These brothers are
really disturbing my research.  NNNNNNNnnnnnn."  Brother Sister trudged 
off, adjusting his glasses as they almost slipped off her nose.
<p>
The other brothers followed suit, and soon the main control room was packed
with brown-robed brothers, sisters and Brother Sister.  Soon, a very
large brother entered and took the floor.
<p>
"Fellow Brothers and Sisters.  I have called you here for a very important
reason.  I now call to order the monthly meeting to determine the status
of Brother Sister."
<p>
"Awww, I just knew it.  NNNNNNhhhnnnnn."
<p>
"We think we have reason to believe that Brother Sister is, in fact, a--"
<p>
<i>Uuhh OOOOO guh, uuhh OOOOO guh!!</i>  A sudden alarm cut him off.  But 
it was not the commonly heard alarm signalling a breach of the grounds.  
This alarm was one none of the Brothers or Sisters had ever hoped to 
hear.  Suddenly, and again without warning, and even taking all of them 
completely by surprise, (not this again) Brothers Big, Maynard, Sister 
and Dave, and Sisters Little, Mila, Mona and Lola disappeared in clouds 
of smoke.  The rest of the assembled immediately panicked.  It
was the last thing they would ever do.
<p>
The atoms of the eight main guardians of the Citadel re-materialized in the
Escape Room, where two pods, labelled "Brother" and "Sister" were
warming their auto-escape engines.  The Sisters ran to their pod, and Big 
Brother, Brother Maynard, and Brother Dave rushed to the "Brother" pod.  
Brother Sister was left standing in the middle, trying to decide which 
pod to enter.
<p>
The Sisters' pod zoomed off down the launch pad, but the bay door failed to
open.  The pod slammed into it and immediately burst into flames.
<p>
"Brother Sister, come with us!!  There's no time for this gender
mess!" Big Brother ordered.  "You weren't transported here for no reason!  We
actually (*gulp*) NEED you!"
<p>
"Oh, Ok...  NNNNhhnnnnn..."  Brother Sister ran to the remaining pod.
<p>
After Brother Sister secured his seat belt, the pod took off, managing to 
clear the rusty but opened bay doors.  Just before the pod cleared the
grounds, Brother Maynard remembered his Holy Charge.  "The Holy 
HandGrenade!!!" all four brothers shouted in unison.  Immediately, 
Brother Maynard pushed a small button attached to his collar and the 
sacred weapon materialized in his hand.  "Gotcha, my pet!" he said,
crooning.
<p>
As the pod soared away, Brother Dave stared back at the smoke rising from the
destroyed Sisters' pod and frowned.  They would miss the four Sisters
greatly.  "NOT!!!"
<p>
Within seconds, the pod reached its destination, swerving past the Rangers
just as Dr. Who had made his second conclusion, and it plummeted down the 
black hole, which they knew to be an escape from the Wasteland 
<fontsize=1>TM</font>.  The ancient Brothers and Sisters from David's 
(Ben's brother) game of Wasteland <fontsize=1>TM</font> had discovered the
modem cable and had somehow handed down the escape route technology to the
brothers of Ben's game.
<p>
The pod slithered down a long winding tube, and then crashed through a light
barrier, finally lodging itself with tremendous force into a thick wall
of circuitry in the new world beyond. . . .  "What a trip, man!"  Brother 
Maynard choked.
<p>
"Yeah, Rock Dud," replied an equally shaken but safe Brother Dave.

<strong>Chapter Four (what the heck, we'll skip Three)<br>
Merp: The World Beyond the Wasteland <font size=1>TM</font>
(Earth: The Grid), Fall 1991</strong>
<p>

Dr. Who hurt deeply that Christina had not made it.  He had not pushed Ace for
the details, but if Ace had given up, then it had indeed been useless.  He now
rested in a semi-sleep surely haunted by the last images he had seen of the
Wasteland<font size=1>TM</font>. 
Christina and Ace were two beans out of the same mutated pod.  To outsiders,
their friendship would have been viewed as that of siblings.  They had stuck
together like road pizza on desert tires.
<p>
Dr. Who took survey of the situation.  Pretty Boy had finally recovered from
falling on his mangler collection, and had a nasty bruise on his back to
show for it. Mandarin was busily examining the glowing wall, and probing some
of the three foot wide vertical slits that only became apparent when you felt
the wall.  Napalm was making a weapons check, and the Mayor was busy cleaning
his nails.  Ace looked on gloomily.  The doctor moved to help Mandarin.
"Any luck?"
<p>
"Sure, we'd be able to walk through, but as far as what's beyond, I cannot
tell.  I'm surely not going to stick my head through there. . . Ahhhso, what's
this?" 
<p>
Mandarin's sensitive fingers had run across a rough section of one of
the slits.  It appeared that something had forced it's way through.  "Some metal
object, oh I'd say four feet in diameter, melted through this slit, and judging
from the amount of ablated metal, it was traveling at a very high speed.  And
Doc, get this, the direction of ablation is just so aligned to make it seem like
whatever rushed through here came from the tube through which we fell.  Also,
this melted stuff is still hotter than the rest of the slit edges, so it could
not have happened very long ago."
<p>
"It would appear that we aren't the first to discover this escape," noted Dr.
Who.  "Mayor, you and Napalm tie that grappling hook rope around yourselves and
I'll grab the hook and walk through this slit to see what's beyond.  We can't
spend the rest of our lives in this black box.  Yank me back in three minutes
if I don't return." 
<p>
"Gotcha, cap'n," smiled the eager Mayor.  Ever since he'd joined the party,
he'd felt indebted to his rescuers.  They were really swell dudes, and
they even put up with all of his Spanish speech.  Thank goodness the editors
were kind enough to include English subtitles.
<p>
Dr. Who took hold of the grappling hook and marched forward.  He passed
through a field of energy which made the hairs on his arms stand at attention.
He had no concept of time or distance, for he was extremely dizzy, but it
must have been less than three minutes when he emerged into a glittering world
of computer parts.
<p>
The outside.  Dr. Who had dreamed of this world whenever he had been ordered
into hibernation by Ben.  The thought of being shoved into permanent
hibernation passed his head, but he blanked it out.  He was lost in endless
loops of memories, when he felt a sharp tug that knocked him on his posterior.
He rejoined his fellow Rangers, and they soon followed him down the strange
electronics-encrusted corridors of the world beyond.
<p>
<center><strong>Meanwhile:</strong></center>
<p> 
This Memory Resident Program couldn't believe what she saw.  She woke up for
work this morning, at the regular time of 6:00, for she was never needed
before then. The computer system in which she was residing did not power up
until 7:00, and you know women: takes 'em at least an hour to get ready every
morning.
<p>
As she stretched her appendages in bed, she heard a stomping noise outside
her abode, which turned out to be the CPU for a really big company,
AT&T.  She quickly got up and rushed to the window, and as told already,
she couldn't believe what she saw.  Approaching her location was a big
humongous pair of tweezers with
gargantuous prongs at the end.  She immediately knew she was in danger.
<p>
"I gotta get outta here, pronto!  Come on, Chip, let's scramble!" She kicked her
dog, sleeping under her bed, and grabbed from her closet her emergency
suitcase, complete with all her essentials of living, like her circuit kit,
her MRP detector, which was bleeping off the scale, and some clothes.
Oh yeah, also, within the suitcase, she carried her insurance: an Ion Particle
Beamer she'd found several years ago while patrolling the hard drives.
<p>
Just as the tweezers pinched her house, a mere chip off the old CPU block, she
pulled out her Beamer and blasted a hole in one wall, knowing escape was
the better strategy than attack or defense.  Chip immediately bolted out the
hole, and Merp quickly followed.
<p>
She jumped out about ten feet in the air, for her house had been picked up
already.  The MRP, a really quick thinker, realized the impact her fall
could have on her personage.  She positioned her suitcase under her, and
landed with much crunchings and grindings.  "Awww, Chip, look what I did!
MRP fewmets! I trashed my circuit kit and my detector, too!"  But there was no
time to throw away useless baggage.  She couldn't stall with the MCP right
there.
<p>
The MRP scrambled to her feet, scooping up Chip in the same motion, and
dashed for the nearest cover: the giant legs of the CPU itself!  "It's
got such a big chip on his shoulders, it'll never think of looking down here!"
Luckily, she was right, and to her delight, she was able to walk safely in the
CPU's shadow until it
passed close to a wastebasket, and downloaded her house into null space.  She
slipped inside the disposal and was shoved outside the AT&T realm: right
into the path of six scruffy-lookin' nerfherders.  ("Who're ya callin' scruffy
lookin'?")
<p>
 Well, actually, Mandarin wasn't too scruffy-lookin'.  In fact, she was lookin'
pretty good.
<p>
Dr. Who immediately addressed the surprise visitor, who was herself, rather
surprised, in fact she looked blue in the face.  "Excuse me, you mustn't
be startled."
<p>
The evacuated computer program looked at the six entities in front of her. 
They looked like her, but instead of having blue skin glowing in streaks,
as was the latest fashion among MRP's like her, they had dull tan skin ranging
in dark to lighter hues.  She'd never seen the likes of any MRP's like them
before.  Her first reaction to the strangers was to run, for how could she know;
they could represent the latest technological breakthrough to replace her!
<p>
"Look, guys, I don't know why you're here.  I was doing a great job!  Never
allowed one stinking virus to get through.  I'm inclined to treat you guys as
a threat to the system, and eradicate you all," she said, hefting her Ion
Beamer, "but I guess that wouldn't do anything.  I'm out of a job as of now.
Well, good luck, fellow MRP's.  You'll need it in this memory block."  She
turned around and walked off.
<p>
"Come on Chip, let's vector this sector, skip this chip, hit the data bus, Gus."
<p>
"Wait, Miss."  Dr. Who spoke up.
<p>
She turned rather impatiently to face them, and propped her Beamer on her
shoulder like a knapsack.  "Yeah?  What do YOU want?  Want to get rid of
me, too?  I see. . . .  Well, I won't go down without a fight!"  She immediately
un-propped her Beamer and pointed it directly at the tall lanky one who had
addressed her.
<p>
"No no no!  You don't understand."  the veteran Ranger protested to Merp. 
And to the camera:  "Actually, we don't understand either!"  And again
to the strange azure-skinned
woman: "We just wandered here.  We don't know what is going on, but we do know
that we are not viruses or MRP's or whatever!"
<p>
"Maybe you can help us," Napalm spoke up, stepping forward, and eager to get
the young woman's attention.  "My name is Napalm.  This is the Doc."
<p>
"Doctor who?"  Merp asked.
<p>
"Yes!"  Doctor looked puzzled at the strange woman.
<p>
"It seems you know a lot about us," Napalm retorted.  At this time, everyone
was baffled, except Chip, who was taking care of doggie business.
<p>
"We're from the Wasteland<fontsize=1>TM</font>, er, Nevada, New Nevada.
Actually, we useta be a buncha characters in a computer game, but we escaped
right 'fore the game terminated."  Napalm explained.
<p>
"Not all of us."  Ace mumbled, rubbing his head, and thinking of Christina.
<p>
They seemed friendly enough to Merp, but she was feeling quite out of place
right now, and didn't want any responsibilities.  "Well, fellas, your
being computer game entities clears things up a bit; thought your skin looked
a bit funny.  I don't
know what you're asking me to do, but you'd probably be better off asking my
replacements, who apparently just moved in on top of my old house.  You
see, I'm an MRP, a Memory Resident Program.  Actually, I don't have a name.
I'm just Central Point Anti-Virus version 1.0.  I guess they got a new version
in. . . .  Ha ha!  Anyway, my dog Chip calls me Merp!"
<p>
"MERP!!  MERP!!"  Chip came running, and the Mayor started to pet the little
chipper.
<p>
"It would seem that all of us are bereft of a place to live.  Hmmm. . .  Why
don't you join us, er, Merp?"  Dr. Who asked delicately.  Merp seemed to
have a fragile temper.  Unfortunately, Dr. Who's charisma was not very
impressive.  Merp balked.
<p>Mandarin, whose personality, when she allowed it, could be a little more
magnetic, stepped in and took Merp aside:  "Merp, I'm Mandarin.  Don't
worry about these guys: they're harmless.  I think we would all benefit from
this union.  Why don't you give us a try?"
<p>
"Well, OK, Mandarin, I guess I could use the company.  It got kinda boring in
that old AT&T memory shell all the time.  OK guys, I'm in for the time
being, but lay one hand on me and you're charged particles," she stated,
with her Ion Beamer looking rather menacing, and quite capable of reducing
Pretty Boy to a cloud of quarks, as Pretty Boy agreed with a gulp.  
<p>
"Let's see if we can set ourselves up in a bulletin board somewhere," she said
to Mandarin, and started walking down the circuitry-laden hallway.
<p>
"Eh, there was one a those on the wall at Ranger Center with all those swimsuit
calendars stuck on it!" Napalm chimed in, pleased that he could connect with the
young lady.  Merp swerved around, barely suppressing her laughter at Napalm's
obliviousness, frowned at Napalm, and looked at Mandarin with a helpless
expression.
<p>
"Harmless!" the stealthy Chinese Ranger mouthed in Merp's direction.  And to
Ape, er, Nape, she translated:  "It's uh, obviously not something with
which we are familiar, Nape."
<p>
"Y'all'll find out. C'mon grizzly dudes, I'll show ya the Grid" bounced Merp. 
She was quite young, but would turn out to be a valuable asset to the party. 
("Party?  Where?")

<strong>Chapter Five<br>
Fewmets: Earth: Ben's Zimmer, Fall 1991</strong><p>
 
"URRRRRrrrrrp!  Aaaaaahhh.  Nothing like a good post-meal burp to get all the
grease fumes out of my system."  Ben took pride in his belch, as he booted
up his computer for another session of Wasteland<font size=1>TM</font>.
He had made real big progress the last time he had played, and finally had
gotten to the point where it wasn't old news, for he and Dave had started
a game once together and played for a couple hours.  After
eating some choke and puke at the Caf', he was in the mood to do nothing
but veg' for a while on his 'puter, and what was better than escaping to the
Wasteland<font size=1>TM</font>?
<p>
He typed the keystrokes to bring him to the game, and instead of the initial
title screen, he received a message:  "Bad File on Disk."
<p>
"Uh oh. . . .  No way!"  Ben grew perturbed.  "Awww DRAGON FEWMETS!!!" 
Nothing Ben typed could continue the game.  He tried to be calm and
collected, and repowered his system.
<p>
But again, "FEWMETS!!!"  It was useless.  Ben had lost the game by turning the
computer off before saving the Wasteland<font size=1>TM</font>!  Dr. Who,
Napalm, Christina, Pretty Boy, Mayor Pedros, and Ace were now lost forever!
"Just great, really great.  Poor guys, they never knew what hit 'em."  Ben
crashed on his bed and veg'ed there instead.
<p>
Ben's roommate chuckled to himself, but only briefly, for he was in the middle
of a game of Gauntlet II<font size=1>TM</font>.

<hr>
<strong>Chapter Six<br>
DoD:  The Grid, Fall 1991</strong><p>

The four surviving brothers from the Citadel were having the time of their
lives.  "So much technology to handle!"  Brother Sister couldn't believe
her eyes.  He and the other brothers:  Brother Maynard, Guardian of technology
(namely the Holy HandGrenade), Brother Dave, Minister of Propaganda and
Communications, and Big Brother, All Around Head Honcho, had built a
settlement in an unoccupied sector of memory in a South Central Bell
mainframe.  Well, at least it wasn't occupied now.  They had to do some house
cleaning before they could call the memory sector their new
Citadel, but it was hardly a Herculanean task to vaporize a few unprotected
bytes from a clock program with their Meson Cannon and Laser Rifles.  A
lonely operator of one of the terminals at South Central Bell never did
realize that his screen clock was moving backwards in time.  He was too busy
playing Tetris<font size=1>TM</font> behind the boss's back.
<p>
Brother Dave had rigged a connection to one of the local bulletin boards, and
was trying to surmise as to how extensive the communications system operated.
His keen senses told him that all the communication links had to lead
somewhere -- to some master control center.
<p>
"Hey Big Chee. . . er, Big Brothah!  I found it!  I knew there had to be some
place that had connections everywhere!  They call it the Department of
Defense, or the DoD and man it's huge!  Mucho info, honcho!  Bro Sis will
find all she needs to get us settled in the technology here."
<p>
Big Brother enthusiastically acknowledged Brother Dave's find.  "Good work,
brother.  Any news of anyone else escaping the Wasteland~?  Especially those
confounded Rangers.  They were the only others who were smart enough of
escaping the holocaust, and they were right there at the Hole.  It's a good
thing our forefathers had enough sense to tag a few of us from birth with
those implanted teleport beacons to save our skins before the master switch
in the vast heavens made its fateful click and sent all life as we know it
into eternal oblivion. . . ."  Big Brother stared off into space, nearly
reverting to his preaching mode.
<p>
"NNNNNnnnnnn, hey guys. . . ."  The noisy entrance of Brother Sister jolted
Big Brother back to reality and he grimaced.  "So what's new, schmoo?  Figure
out which bathroom to use yet?"
<p>
"NNNNnnnn. . . stop it. . . . Nnnnn," Brother Sister said, squinching up his
face.  No one in the entire Wasteland~ knew what gender this diminutive but
ingenious Brother had.  When she was a kid, he played with G.I. Bro and
Power Assault Barbie (with working Uzi).  He was always ordering Roy Rogerses
as well as Shirley Temples at the local bars, too.  Big Brother just resigned
himself to the fact that Brother Sister would never reveal her true identity,
but regardless, he needed his brains, for without them, they wouldn't have a
chance in the Grid.
<p>
"I think, NNNnnnnn, that somebody should go investigate that DoD line, since
we don't know what kind of security it has.  NNnnnn, we can't just walk
in and take the technology and leave.  Something that big will be protected
from intruders like us. . . ."
<p>
"Good point, brother.  I volunteer you to go," ordered Big Brother.  His
commands were so short and sweet that one just couldn't refuse to obey.
<p>
"Oooooohhh.  Alright," whined Brother Sister.
<p> 
<strong>Later that day:</strong>
<p>
The ride on the Data Bus wasn't too bad, but it had crashed shy of the DoD
gateway due to a local I/O bus error.  Brother Sister jumped out the
trashed bus and headed cautiously toward the gates of the giant DoD outpost.
He had rigged an anti-detection field around herself from a few spare parts
he'd pulled from the Grid itself.  The gates were thick and menacing.  No
way through here.  She walked a little way beyond the gates and found a hole
melted in the wall, still smoking.  "Strange," the brother thought.
<p>
He crawled through the hole and switched her visor goggles to low-lumen mode. 
The inside of the DoD network was a myriad of dim lights, silent movement, and
humming electronics.  "Heaven!" Brother Sister exclaimed to himself.
<p>
As he sneaked around the complex hugging the outside perimeter, she could
not help but wonder:  "The technology is certainly here, but now, what
about the protection?  Surely, such a big operation such as this would need
pro. . . ."
<p>
KABOOOOM!!  KRAACKK!  KABOOOM!!  Suddenly, not far from where Brother
Sister lay crouched in the shadows came deafening explosions and the whistling
of explosive shells.  "Sounds like a Vegan Mark VI tank!  Here comes the
protection," he thought, recalling the menace of autonomous artillery in
the streets of his hometown Vegas.  In fact, Brother Sister was not far from
correct.  Emerging from the recesses of a dark corridor to her distant right
came running a large human who was carrying a smaller slender human who toted
a large rifle.  Three elephantine tanks soon rolled out in pursuit of the two
fleeing humans.  Shells burst all around them, and suddenly, the hefty human
was knocked to his knees by a particularly close explosion.  His living burden
was thrown a few yards away, dazed, and the gun landed nearby.
<p>
A second blue blast from the tanks seemed to melt the larger human's legs into
the floor.  He lay on the floor circuitry writhing in certain pain and
yelling something to his female companion, who was now up and running away.
<p>
Brother Sister watched in horror as the tanks stopped their shooting and
rolled ever closer.  "They must be in fragile territory to have stopped
their shelling," the petrified brother thought.  He moved to a better
position to discern the humans more closely.
<p>
"<Gasp> RANGERS??" Brother Sister nearly exclaimed out loud.  This couldn't
be!  However, sure enough, that had been the crack of a Ranger M1911A1
.45 caliber pistol, and that was the tell-tale silhouette and zing of a
Citadelian Ion Beamer, now in the hands of the maimed man, miraculously
still fighting.
<p>
"INFIDELS!" the brother in hiding screamed, but the noise of an explosion
swallowed his fervent shout furiously.  The brethren were sworn to kill
on sight desecraters of their sacred fortress, but Brother Sister was not
about to give away her position and be hunted in turn by the mammoth tanks,
all for an unconfirmed resemblance of a stolen Ion Beamer.  He merely sat in
fury and steamed up in the inside of her goggles.
<p>
The slow-moving tanks were nearly on top of the fallen Ranger, but the Ion
Beamer look-alike was punching all kinds of holes into the tank bearing
down on his position.  Brother Sister only caught a glimpse of the mobile
Ranger, who was trucking it toward the hole through which he herself had
come fifteen minutes previous.  Suddenly the entire complex shook with a
tremendous explosion.  The fallen Ranger had exploded one of the tanks!
No! Two!!  The whole place was now heavy with alarms and smoke and shrapnel.
Brother Sister decided to make his escape.  She'd seen enough to convince
him that infiltration into the DoD was pretty heinous.  But now the Citadel
would have a larger concern: elimination of the hated desert Rangers!

<hr>
<strong>Chapter Seven<br>
Big Decision:  Grid: Ranger HQ2, Fall 1991, two days before Chapter Six
</strong><p>
 
"Napalm, after you are done with the door, see if you can make a couple
windows.  It's pretty dark in here!"  Dr. Who surveyed the makeshift
headquarters which the Rangers so desperately needed.  He was tired of
running, of wandering. It was time to accept their new lifestyle and settle
down, at least until they found a way back home.  But where was home?
Without a sure answer, the Doctor was lost in thought.
<p>
As requested, Napalm rubbed his wrists, cracked his knuckles, and punched
through the hard plastic wall, ripping down sizable holes for windows.
Soon the base was well ventilated and lit from the outside.  Through the new
window, Dr. Who could see in big red letters written on the wiring that
surrounded the sizable cubicle they would now call HQ2:
"property of CompuServe."
<p>
Pulling out his nifty blade, Napalm now carved the window more aesthetically,
being somewhat artistically inclined.  As he carved away he uncovered a
piece of a metal grate which was inscribed "Jax was here" and had a minute
dragon carving beneath the lettering.
"Would you look at that!" he exclaimed, doing a double take
in Dr. Who's direction.  Nape only caught a glance from Dr. Who which
seemed to say: "Oh, brother...".  Napalm shrugged, and carved away.
<p>
After setting up rooms, Merp showed Dr. Who her broken instruments.  She
pulled out her suitcase, and dumped it on a makeshift computer chip
table. Her broken circuit kit and her MRP detector crashed to the table,
tangled up in a red lace material.  Doctor Who blushed as Merp untangled her
panties--all five pieces of them--from the broken parts.
Merp looked at Doctor Who.  "Uh, must have gotten thrown
in there my mistake. . .  Uh, ahem.  Doc, if you squeal," she suddenly
changed her tone of voice, "I'll make you wear them!"
<p>
Doc gulped, and quickly regained his composure.  "Well, as much as I would
like to impress you with my finite but unbounded knowledge, I am afraid my
understanding of electronics is very limited.  I will try, however."  Dr. Who
grimaced, but he was eager to figure the broken gadgets out.
<p>
"If my circuit kit were fixed, we could tap into the main network
of CompuServe," Merp informed Dr. Who, who listened as he spread out the broken
parts on a table.  "Then we could locate anything we wanted to throughout the
whole country."
<p>
Dr. Who looked up, even more puzzled than before.
<p>
Merp explained:  "You see, I've heard of Wasteland~.  The user who installed
me, and also replaced me, that lousy no-good. . . ., ahem, used to play
it while the boss wasn't lookin'.  It really isn't 1998 yet, Doc.
I don't know whether that's good or bad news for ya, but it's really 1991."
<p>
Dr. Who understood, but he decided not to explain to the rest of his group.  It
would take weeks for Napalm to figure it out.
<p>
"So when I say 'throughout the whole country', I mean the same country,
America.  But the time is the present, not the relatively pessimistic
future of the Wasteland<font size=1>TM</font>."
<p>
In one sense, Dr. Who was relieved that there had been no World War III.  But
in another, he was disheartened to finally face up to the fact that they
had been living in a fictitious world.  It scared him to know that he was in
"the real world" now.  And he thought finding a job after college was hard!
<p>
Within a few hours, Merp and Dr. Who were able to piece together all the parts
of Merp's circuit kit, and she explained how it worked.  Dr. Who felt
that if he still had ratings of strength, I.Q., etc. as measured by the
Wasteland<font size=1>TM</font>, he would have a
hiked Electronics understanding.
<p>
Merp led Dr. Who outside, where she showed him how to tap into the wiring. 
Reading from the somewhat scratched console, they discovered that the
only signals they could read emanated from a place called the Department of
Defense.
<p>
"Oh, yeah, the DoD.  They've got their noses into everything,
defense-related or not.  They'd
have a connection anywhere you'd need to go."  As Dr. Who learned more
and more about the world of 1991, he longed more and more for his own world,
limited as it seemed.
<p>
"What would it take to look into this Defense Department, Merp?  I know this
may sound crazy to you, but I somehow cannot believe that my old world
is completely lost.  We need to find a link to Birmingham, where Ben is,"
the Doctor asked, as the
two were joined by the rest of the Rangers, curious and wide-eyed at the
prospect of returning to the only place they knew as home.
<p>
Merp continued, "Yeah, the DoD would have info on everything, and surely has
a link to Birmingham.  Oh, but you don't want to go the DoD!  Anti-virus
tanks all over the place!  Certain death to trespassers!  A not too bright
friend of mine went in there on a dare, and never came back: she was
derezzed!  Then again, screen savers were never that bright.
As soon as she lingered too long in one spot, she
started emanating flying toasters from her dish-head and producing them on the
President's monitor!  They caught her immediately, poor girl.  I guess
you could say that chick was toast!  Anyway, the security is so tight
around there, it's impossible to take anything out with you."
<p>
Doctor Who persisted, "Yet, it's the only way to get any further in my party's
search for home!  I tell you what, I'll go pay the place a visit and see
if I can find the Birmingham connection.  I know enough from repairing your
kit to find the ID on
those lines, and as far as finding the DoD, well I'm sure that is easy
enough since they have connections everywhere.  The sooner we get out of here,
the better.  Our rations are running low, and I'm sure food doesn't grow as
plentiful as the spare parts around here."
<p>
"You're right on that last note, Doctor, but still, my warning stands.  I
think you're crazy.  This Wasteland<font size=1>TM</font> of yours
must be worth a whole lot to throw your life away on a long shot like this!"
a rather incensed Merp exclaimed.
<p>
"Man, I sure could go for a nice rad rat pizza right now!" Ace chimed in to
lighten the mood a little.  His eyes were met by Merp's ire before his
face was met by an elbow, which was attached to Napalm, who didn't like to see
Merp angry, and was trying so hard to get on her good side.
Merp's gaze softened a bit as it flitted across Nape's eyes.
<p>
Mandarin put in her two bits. "Listen Merp, Doc's right.  And I have to agree
with Ace.  I'm homesick.  We have absolutely no place in this world.  I
mean, besides Doc, we're a bunch of techno-idiots!  Just look at
Peanuts for example."
<p>
Pretty Boy stuttered a feeble reply, "Hey, I --"
<p>
"Sorry kiddo, but face it, even you have a better chance of
hitting a mile-distant bucket of ice with a heat seeker than you have of
knowing the difference between a bulletin board and the DoD!"
Mandarin explained.
<p>
"Well, then, I guess ya'll should go.  But I'm not going.  As much as I've
decided to team up with you guys, I guess I don't feel comfortable
risking my life in the DoD grid to send you away.
But I don't want you guys to leave.  I mean, we could
do great stuff together.  You don't have to be techno-idiots for life,
you know.  I'm a good teach--"
<p>
Dr. Who interjected:  "I see it as our only alternative, Merp.  I hope you
understand."
<p>
Seeing their faces unchanged, and their minds made up, Merp gave in.  "Well,
let me get my Beamer.  You'll need it."
<p>
Dr. Who received instructions on the Beamer from Merp ("You got 8 shots, so
spare 'em.  It's just point and shoot, Doc."), and was about to strap on
some of Pretty Boy's manglers, when the Mayor approached him.
<p>
"Doctor, I'd like you to reconsider going out dere."
<p>
"What do you mean?  I thought you were behind us on this!"
<p>
"Well, it's just dat.  I am.  I don't want you to get dere, discover a
platoon of anti-viruses or whatever, and get your brains smeared out all over
New Nev--, er, wherever we are.  I tink somebody more expendable should go."
<p>
At this, Ace started
fidgeting and looking rather nervous, flashing his gaze to everybody's
face to check their body language.  He was the odd man out, he knew it.  Even
Pretty Boy was good in a battle.  But he?  He felt like comic relief.
Suddenly, he didn't like the boots he
was wearing and went back inside HQ2 to take them off and put them back on. 
Anything to escape being expendable.
<p>
Oblivious to Ace's departure, the Mayor continued, "Somebody who's not our
leader.  Somebody who doesn't have reason to return to da
Wasteland<font size=1>TM</font>. . . .  I can
only tink of one person is so expendable.  I tink. . . I should go."
<p>
The Rangers' jaws dropped simultaneously, and Ace dashed back to the group,
feeling a big weight having been lifted.  Dr. Who stuttered in disbelief,
"Mayor, I. . .  I. . . I must object --"
<p>
"I'm sorry, Doctor.  I won't change me mind.  Just as you won't change yours
about getting home.  And it's no use risking yourself now.  If you're
gone, who'll lead da party?  I have nothing back home.
My wife is dead, my family, dead."
<p>
"What about your dog?" Ace chimed in, no longer feeling that constricted-neck
feeling you get when you think everybody's watching you.
<p>
"Dead."
<p>
"Uh, what about your mother-in-law?"
<p>
"Dead."
<p>
"Are you trying to tell me. . . ."
<p>
"Dead.  Dere all dead.  Ace, dere dead, dude.  Dere ALL DEAD!"
<p>
"Your pet attack newt?"
<p>
"DEAD!!  Don't you see, I have nutting!  And dat mayoral job never paid well
anyway. . . .  Doctor, you must let me go. . . .  Now dat's an order from your
Mayor. I don't know how much jurisdiction I have here, but I want to tink you
still respect our homeland's regulations."
<p>
"You know I will, Mayor."  Dr. Who respectfully submitted.
<p>
"Dat settles it den.  I leave in de morning."

<strong>Chapter Eight<br>
Gain and Loss:  Ranger HQ2, Fall 1991, the day of Chapter Six</strong>
<p>

Mayor Pedros did leave the next morning, armed with only his standard issue
M1911A1 .45 caliber pistol which he'd hung onto since the Vermin Skirmishes of
Quartz back in '88, and his hands, which were deadly weapons themselves.
The Mayor had trained in the Nevada army, and had developed his brawling and
pugilism skills to greatness.  Accompanying him, however surprisingly,
was Merp.  She realized that since Mayor Pedros wasn't trained in the use of
energy weapons, she should go so her Ion Particle Beamer could be fully
effective if they should need it.  And on top
of that, she was touched by the Mayor's genuineness and sincerity and
mostly his courageous braveness.
<p>
"I guess I'm kind of curious about the DoD
myself.  And, even though this is only supposed to be a recon' mission,
the Mayor will need some back up, especially against the anti-intruder MRP's.
But FIRST sign of trouble, and we're outta there, Mayor."
<p>
Merp hefted her Ion Beamer, and took along several of Pretty Boy's hand
grenades.  She also brought her MRP detector, which Dr. Who had fixed the night
before.  The Doc was really getting the hang of all her electronic stuff.  So,
the Rangers sent off the Mayor and Merp with a somber yet serious farewell.
Each knew that they might never see the other again.
And just in case that would happen, Merp
and Doctor Who had fashioned a back up plan.  She drew a map of how to
get to the Department of Defense, and if the two failed, the remaining Rangers
could attempt to infiltrate again at a later time.  One further condition.
They would adopt Chip. 
<p>
Napalm had insisted that wouldn't be necessary, for they'd come back,
for sure. Merp, a little less certain, silently thanked Napalm for his vote of
confidence with a tensing of her lips and a salute with her eyelids.
<p>
As soon as Merp and the Mayor departed, Pretty Boy, using his love for AT
weapons and demolitions, Mandarin, utilizing her extremely dexterous
fingers, and Dr. Who, making full use of his new electronic and mechanical
skills, started to fashion rail guns and ammo out of their surroundings,
for they needed to supplement their
dwindling weaponry.  "We gotta make some kinda protection for ourselves,
or else we're toast, dudes."  Mandarin suggested.
<p>
The Rangers re-routed CompuServe wire, and used it to fashion a new kind of
thick rubber-plastic armor.  They wanted to be able to take on the DoD
in case a full scale attack was needed to get home; they had been warned by
Merp about CPAV tanks.  Chip even helped.  He could sniff out the rubber
power cord like the best of the New Nevada rad-bird-dogs.
<p>
Napalm set up a perimeter watch.  "Man, Excalibur, you lookin' good!  MMMmmm 
MMMM!  Let's see. . ."  He had found a really tough piece of grated metal and
he immediately began sharpening his adamantium knife with the
sand-paper-metal, but he found that he couldn't distract himself from his
apprehension.
<p>
<hr width=50%>
<p>
About three hours later, Chip started barking loudly.  Napalm was sitting
outside HQ2, half on guard, half watching Chip chase his tail, when he
noticed the dog suddenly stop, raise its ears, and then bolt out, yelping.
<p>
"MERP!!  MERP MERP!!!"
<p>
Chip ran back panting, accompanied by an equally panting Merp.  By now all
the Rangers had gathered outside to investigate the barking.  As Merp
reached the base, she collapsed into Napalm's massive arms.
<p>
"Hold me!"
<p>
Doctor Who rushed up and immediately performed his Doctor skill on the
bleeding woman.  She had a few cuts and scratches, and a nasty looking burn
on her left arm.  Napalm carried the now unconscious Merp to the base,
laid her on a bed of
coaxial wire, and held her white-knuckled hand.  Dr. Who reported:
<p>
"She's stabilized,
but I can't tell when she'll wake up.  Her body is exhausted.  She must
have run all the way here after who knows what hit her. . . .
and Peydros. . . ."
<p>
Chip jumped up on the bed and began licking Merp's face, and unexpectedly,
Merp smiled.  She picked up the dog and started crying, and then realized
where she was.
<p>
"Oh, guys. . . it was terrible.  The Mayor.  He's. . ."  Dr. Who
closed his eyes and shuddered, and felt the heat of self-anger traveling
up his spine and into his face.  Merp sat up and related her story. 
<p>
"We got to the DoD just fine, but the thing was jam packed with security
sensors and thick walls.  We considered just reporting this and turning
back, but the Mayor's perception noticed a weak spot on one of the side walls.
He thought he could almost punch through, but he wanted to save his strength
and his knuckles for
bashing other things.  I guess we both knew that this thing would have
animated guards somewhere.
<p>
Anyway, we backed up, crouched down, all the while avoiding the cameras, and
I melted a hole in the wall using the lower settings of my Beamer.  We
rushed in just in time to miss the next pass of the camera.
Fortunately, the camera didn't extend it's
sight to the actual building it was protecting, so it never saw the hole
we made.
<p>
"We got in there, and it was like a library.  Only the books weren't books. 
They were access tunnels which lead to everywhere!  Places we'd never
heard of were on those shelves!  We looked up and down the rows and rows of
shelves, and miraculously stumbled upon a route leading to a place called
Birmingham!  Isn't that where your User lives?"
<p>
Dr. Who's eyes grew wide, and his superior intelligence kicked in
gear.  "Yes!  If we could get back there, we could get back into his computer,
and maybe we could get back home!"
<p>
"But what happened to the Mayor?"  Mandarin spoke up sharply,
interrupting Dr. Who's train of thought.
<p>
"Well, almost as soon as we found the Birmingham link-up, security
found us. Five huge tanks just appeared from nowhere, and all of them had
their nozzles pointed directly at us.  Too bad for them that they appeared
so close.  Before they could get us, the Mayor had already sprung into action
and punched holes into one
of them, totally destroying it!  Soon after, I hit the deck and aimed
for one of them, and the Beamer melted a hole right through it.
I mean, tank parts were flying everywhere!  But the other three immediately
closed in on us, and more were
appearing everywhere!  He ducked out of the way just in time, for the
tank fired a weird blue beam!  The heat from it was almost unbearable!
<p>
"We hightailed it out of the line of their fire behind one of the
shelves where we thought it couldn't squeeze, but suddenly we were looking
into the nozzles of their cannons!  We made a break for the hole we'd blasted,
and all the while the tanks were firing at us.  That's when my arm got fried.
I tripped from the blast, but the
Mayor just scooped me up with his huge hands and kept running.  Then they fired
again, and suddenly, I was on the ground again.  The Mayor's legs. . . .
They'd been incinerated.  Ohhh.  It was terrible,"
<p>
Merp just about lost it, and Napalm looked up
at Dr. Who with helpless eyes.  It seemed as if the master medic had
visibly aged before his eyes.  Mandarin embraced Merp while Pretty Boy kicked
the circuits beneath his foot, and Ace, in a somber trance, rubbed his flak
vest pocket.
<p>
Merp continued when she'd recovered, "But he never gave up.  He grabbed the
Beamer, and wheeling around on his side, whipped open the tripod and
started wide-beaming them, like I'd shown him how on the way over.
He turned back only to yell at me.
<p>
"He told me to run.  That's it.  The look in his eyes was past desperation and
past direct order.  There was no other choice.  I took off, and the last
thing I heard was another explosion.  I figured he took out at least two more
before. . . before. . . ." 
<p>
Merp broke down crying, and Chip snuggled against her leg.  Ace couldn't
take all the emotion and went back inside, coughing to hide his grief.
<p>
By this time, Napalm was torn with disbelief and devastation, Pretty Boy's head
hung low, a rare tear streamed down Mandarin's face, and Dr. Who looked
up, hand clasping his forehead.
<p>
"I sent them in there to die.  I knew it was a doomed trip.  Why!"
<p>
Merp recovered to say, "No, Doc!  We did our mission.  Ya'll be proud of him! 
We found you a way home!  There is a connection there!  And we'll go back,
because I know the way, and feel indebted to the Mayor for my life.
Anyway, I know how those tanks operate.  I mean, I am one of them, you know."
<p>
Doctor Who gave Merp a puzzled look.  She's one of them?  Not any more.  "No
Merp, you're one of us now.  We won't leave you there.  You're coming
home with us." 
<p>
It was a bold proposition, but she was good Ranger material, and they
had grown accustomed to her company.
<p>
Merp's face flushed.  Dr. Who braced himself, and Mandarin swallowed hard. 
<p>
"Doc. . . that's the best news I've heard all day.  I'm tired of the
grid and MRP's, and CPU's, and AT&T's, and FPU's, and. . . ."
Napalm found the pain of the Mayor's death
lightening just a tad as he watched Merp's mouth spout off three letter
acronyms like they were on sale.  The taste of rad rats barbecued over an open
spit under the cool New Nevada skies wafted through his olfactory memory
cells, and now he knew he
liked what Merp said, even though it sounded like alphabet soup.
<p>
"Right.  We'll leave at 1900 hours.  Everyone take a load off and rest
yourselves.  I fear we'll be fighting for our lives tonight."

<strong>Chapter Nine:<br>
The Final Countdown:  Citadel II, Fall 1991</strong>
<p>

"Brother Maynard, report."  The gargantuous voice of Big Brother boomed out
across the meeting room which the four surviving brothers had hastily
constructed as a part of their new base.  Brother Maynard stood up,
his brown hood falling from his head unmasking his face.
<p>
"Report, chapter two, verses one to thirty-seven.  And thus, the four brothers
regrouped at Citadel II and there was much rejoicing, especially now
that they didn't have to use table manners since the sisters were all de--"
<p>
"Skip a bit, brother," yawned Big Brother.
<p>
"Right.  And so Brother Sister reconnoitered and discovered the complex called
DoD, and furthermore made the discovery of the presence of the Infidel
Rangers, and also found by further discovery that the Rangers had in their
possession aforementioned Ion Beamer, stolen from the Citadel during the life
of the arch-Infidel Ranger Jax Yllandian, and considered gone forever with
Yllandian's disappearance, but now
being in the possession of the Infidel, cannot be considered gone
forever and thusly gains the title `stolen and recoverable' and--"
<p>
"Brother, uh, skip some more, please," Big Brother interrupted tersely while
examining the curvature of his fingernails through squinty eyes.
<p>
"Right.  Sorry.  Uh, and thus the Citadelian Brotherhood made a solemn vow,
a most excellent promise, a binding and sacred pact, so help us gosh, to
rid the new world of the scourge of the presence of the smelly Ranger scum,
and to thereby exact
the ultimate revenge upon the slimy Infidels, by wiping their sorry
butts off the face
of the Grid, by tearing their dirty limbs piece by piece and strewing
them all over the--er, sorry, I got carried away.  Thus ends report."
The fervent Brother Maynard
took his seat and wiped the sweat from his brow with his hood.
<p>
"OK.  So we have our mission; now we need a plan.  Brother Sister, have you
finished the homing device?" asked Big Brother, barely able to hide a
smirk at the mere mention of the ambiguous brother.
<p>
"Yes, Nnnnnn, and it's a beauty if I might add."
<p>
"Nobody asked, but go ahead bozo/bozette!" laughed Brother Dave, elbowing
Brother Maynard in the biceps.
<p>
"Out of line Brother Dave!" Big Brother thundered.  Brother Dave piped down.
<p>
"Anyway, Nnnnn, we should be able to get a fix on the Rangers as soon as we
connect a portable power source to the locator.  Following a hunch that
the Rangers are still toting around our stolen Ion Beamer, I'm tracking the
Byllantros radiation emitted by the pulse-modulated hyper-particle
accelerating mechanism located in the
Nnnnn--nanocollider unit of all of our energy weapons, although the
signal I'm getting is weaker than I'd expected--must be the foreign electronic
components producing some resonancy I hadn't counted on."
<p>
The three definitely male brothers
stared in total incomprehension through Brother Sister, their pupils
dilated and their heads shaking vigorously, feigning an understanding of the
intricacies of Ion Beamer guts.
<p>
"Oh, and I've decided that I am a--"
<p>
Immediately the brothers snapped out of their brain clouds and buzzed with
excitement at the hinted revelation of the solution to the age-old
problem of Brother
Sister's sex.  But Brother Sister decided she wasn't up to it today, and
sat down.  (Awwww shucks!)
<p>
Big Brother took control again.  "Right.  Thanks Brother Sister for the data. 
Hook up that power thingy to the whatchamacallit and get to work right away at
finding the Infidels.  They perhaps are behind the thefts of other Citadelian
merchandise and weaponry in the past, and these MUST be recovered or
else. . . ."
<p>
Big Brother stalled.
<p>
"Or else what, Big Brother?"  Brother Maynard innocently questioned,
but averted his gaze.
<p>
"Or ELSE!!  THAT'S WHAT'S ELSE!!!  Don't question me you insolent groveling
crusty idiot scum of the desert!" Big Brother roared with self assurance
that somewhere inside he really knew why the Brotherhood was so prejudiced
against Rangers.  Maybe it was just that they had all the fun.
<p>
Brother Dave interrupted the awkward silence, "Uh, Big Chee--er, Big
Brother, I've got the weapons and armor juiced up for an assault on the
Infidels pending their location by Bro Sis's locator."
<p>
"Excellent, Brother Dave, that's showing initiative.  Brother Sister,
get with the program, eh?  I look forward to making a species extinct."
And with that comment, half to himself, Big Brother left the conference room,
his robes billowing out behind him in a grandiose flurry of importance and
power.
<p>
"What you lookin' at twinkle-toes?  Move your ambisexual butt!" Brother Dave
piped his apprehension into Brother Sister.  Brother Maynard just sat
staring into space, eyebrows perched high, and fingered the button on his
collar.

<hr>
<strong>Chapter Ten<br>
The Final Battle:  DoD, Fall 1991</strong>
<p>
At 1930 hours, the Rangers, led by Merp and Chip located the DoD complex. 
Merp showed them the hole that had already been repaired through which
she and the Mayor had previously entered.  Her hands tightened on the newly
fashioned rail
gun Napalm had christened "Shotsy" with the thought of confronting the
blue heat ray-wielding CPAV tanks.  Chip located another weakness in the
exterior walls of the DoD, and the Ranger party, after Napalm ripped a few
game boards clean out of their sockets to make an entrance, followed Merp
into the eerie cavern that was the DoD.
<p>
Mandarin took the lead, being the stealthiest, and noted many electric sensors
and magnetic fields of which to be cautious.  Her electronics skills had
nearly matched Dr. Who's now, and she had developed the uncanny ability to
sense force fields, perhaps due to the resonant effects of the adamantine
bracers she wore.  She suddenly halted at an unseeming impasse at the end of
a corridor narrowing to a foot wide doorway, where a clear view of the main
hall of the DoD was visible.
<p>
"What's the holdup Mandy?" Ace said as he avoided careening into Pretty Boy
and his mangler collection at the party's halt.
<p>
Quicker than any feline, Mandarin flipped to the back of the party and jammed
Ace against the wall one foot up with one of her adamantium bracers.
<p>
"The name's MANDARIN, Ace, got it?"
<p>
"ok?! sorry!" Ace choked.  She released the dangling Ranger and he looked at
everybody with that "Sheesh guys give me a break" look.  "Jees, Mandarin,
lighten up!"
<p>
"Sorry. . . Ace," she said, brushing the dust off his back in stilted,
ungraceful movements.  Mandarin shuddered and walked apart from the rest, her
knuckles white, her arms rigid and her jaw outlined sharply in the dim light.
<p>
"Doctor!" Merp exclaimed, at the threshold of the portal, which she had been
examining, oblivious to Mandarin's outburst.  "I think I understand why
Mandarin stopped us!  This is no entrance!  It's a giant parallel plate
capacitor!!  And it's fully charged!"
<p>
The Ranger medic, heading haltingly toward Mandarin, stopped in mid-stride,
hesitated and walked back to Merp.  "Good heavens, there must be
millions of volts
across those plates, and with the plates so close, we would cause a fatal
short by squeezing between them!"
<p>
"The perfect trap!" Mandarin said, walking back, her face showing no trace of
whatever memories she had just confronted.  "Touching those plates
simultaneously would be bad.  You wouldn't last a Shanghai second!"
<p>
"Great, we go all this way to get home, and we're stopped by a mutant 
bug-zapper!" Ace spat.
<p>
"There must be another way in besides this gate," Dr. Who looked around
desperately.
<p>
"I'm afraid the CPAV crew must have installed these around the perimeter, for
they weren't here before, and they look spankin' new.  Look, across the
main communications hall -- see the glowing slits?  They're everywhere!" Merp
added.
<p>
Chip started barking, so Pretty Boy picked him up and tried to calm him down,
but instead Chip chomped Pretty Boy's arm!
<p>
"Yeoowwww!! Merp, your do--" Pretty Boy's breath fell short as Chip, in what
must have been viewed as slow motion in the party's eyes, made a suicidal jump
from Pretty Boy's arms toward the killer capacitor entrance.  Merp fell on
her knees trying to catch her dog, and would have plunged to her death had
not Napalm grabbed her
by the waist in the nick of time to save her.  She yelped in terror as
Chip bounded happily through the capacitor-gate.
<p>
"Chiiippp!!"
<p>
"Chip??"  Merp repeated herself in a confused tone, as Chip turned around and
stared at the Rangers and Merp from the other side of the trap.  The dog
had miraculously made it through!
<p>
"So what good does it do if the lousy dog is on the other side? Yeah, go get
'em, Chip!  Chomp those tanks like they're rat bones.  Geez, why didn't
we think of this before?"  Pretty Boy lashed out as he rubbed his arm gingerly.
"Besides, there's no way Ace'll fit through without touching,
not to mention us with all our gear!" 
<p>
Ace felt too subdued to spit out a comeback, so he vowed to get Pretty Boy
back when the authors figured he was in the mood again to be good ol'
party-hard-Ace.  Instead, he queried worriedly, "So, uh, what do we do, Doc?"
<p>
"Well, with Chip on the inside, we may be able to exploit this advantage.
Merp, can you make an educated guess as to the source of the current charging
these plates?  It looks as if Chip is sniffing around some wires behind that
bunker over there," Dr. Who took charge.
<p>
"Let's see, that bunker looks like a step-up transformer and that blue cable
that Chip just uncovered should carry the current," Merp surmised.
<p>
"Chip, good doggie, stay boy!"
<p>
"Who-man, I could snap that wire with Excalibur, if y'all clear the way,"
Napalm volunteered.  "She's insulated."
<p>
"Excellent idea, Napalm.  Everyone back," Dr. Who spread out his arms and
ushered Pretty Boy, Mandarin, Ace and Merp farther back in the corridor.
Napalm quickly threw a sideways glance at Merp, flexed his gargantuous arm
muscles, cracked his knuckles, and with a grand flourish, brandished Excalibur.
He flicked his mirror-shiny knife of adamantium alloy straight through the
electric field between the plates and it sailed through the air effortlessly,
landing into the metal ground amidst a shower of sparks with a solid thwack,
severing the cable as if it were a bun-length hot dog.  The newly loosed ends
of the cable whipped back to their
natural coiled form, and left the shiny knife glinting alone lodged into
the floor circuitry.
<p>
"YES! YES!!" Napalm celebrated.
<p>
Dr. Who held Napalm back as the field decreased in intensity, and the Rangers
and Merp slid through the deactivated zap-trap.  Ace decided he'd go
last, because he didn't want everyone to see his gut rub up against the plates.
Besides, he felt like he still needed to guard the rear.  On the other side,
Napalm was quick to retrieve his blade, which he kissed and then thanked by
polishing it, even though he'd just shined it yesterday.
 
<hr width=50%>

The Rangers, Merp and Chip filed through the DoD complex which was a maze
of wires,  transistors, capacitors, resistors and integrated circuits.
Packets of energy zipped through the imprinted silicon pathways sporadically,
and giant heat sinks clouded the view of the far end of the arena.
Everything had a thin patina of
dust which has collected silently over the years.  Light-emitting diodes
peppered the rim of the arena, marking gateways to other lands,
according to Merp.  Merp pointed these things out quietly to the party as she
led them to where she thought the Birmingham gate was located, on the far
side somewhere.  Every Ranger was on edge, knowing very well that any minute
CPAV tanks could come
rolling in with their nasty welding beams.  Napalm sniffed the air and
crinkled his nose.  "I smell something familiar," he whispered.
<p>
"Yeah me too.  Say, d'you use deode' today?" Ace nudged Napalm.
<p>
Apparently, the authors figured he was in a good mood again.
<p>
"Listen, grease-face. . . ."
<p>
"Ahso!"  Mandarin crouched to the dusty floor.  She mouthed, "Human tracks! 
Look!"  Sure enough, there were humanoid prints in the dust!
<p>
Merp was confused. This was no place for MRP's like herself.
And they were fresh too!  "They lead over behind that heat sink," Merp pointed
out.
<p>
"Rangers, yellow alert," Dr. Who warned.  Pretty Boy loaded a mangler while
Mandarin clicked off the safety on her M1989A1 assault rifle and
squinted through the dim light at the heat sink.
Napalm checked his own rifle and unsheathed
Excalibur, making sure it glinted into Ace's eyes.  Dr. Who and Merp
took cover behind a cylindrical resistor and Ace defiantly cocked his AK97
and snapped his flak vest shut.  Napalm advanced following the tracks, and
Mandarin covered him.
<p>
Ace walked over to a variable resistor, away from Excalibur, in hopes to gain
a better angle to cover Napalm and Mandarin, not that they needed
covering or anything, but he felt like he had to be doing something.
He felt like an empty beer can, no longer useful for anything important
except for being crushed against your
forehead when the babes were looking.  Then again, he didn't much feel like a
crushed beer can, either.  He awoke from his daze of self-pity too late
to notice the escalating hum of the Citadelian laser rifle.
<p>
KZACK!!!!
<p>
The attack had all the advantages of complete surprise.  The lethal
photon stream vaporized entire plates of Ace's lower armor, and his legs
instantly buckled underneath him, "AMBUSH!!"
he barely managed to shout before he clattered
painfully to the circuit board and slipped into unconsciousness.
<p>
"Attack brothers!  Destroy the Infidel once and for all!!"  Big Brother rallied
as he sprouted from behind a transistor, his weapon smoking, and pursued
the regrouping Rangers.  Dr. Who leaped over to Ace's position as soon as
the ambushers passed.  "One, two, three, . . . four.  Frak!  How'd the
Citadel get here?"  His mind
raced to explain the existence of the Brethren in this world while he
patched up Ace and stabilized him, in the relative safety of a ganglion of
wires which had shielded Ace luckily from the full force of the surprise
attack.  Dr. Who heard shouts and the thud-thud-thud of uranium bullet
bursts from Napalm's and Mandarin's rifles.  The fighting raged close by,
but it seemed that he and Ace were safe for the. . . .
<p>
Without warning, beams of vorpal radiation sheared some of the wires
protecting the Doctor and Ace.  Electricity sparked everywhere.  Quickly
calculating the trajectories of the beams, Dr. Who whipped around and ripped
a full clip of his .45 automatic into the shower of sparks where he'd
correctly guessed his enemy lay. 
<p>
A liquid coolant pipe exploded and sent up a tremendous dense cloud of
dust, vapor and shrapnel.
<p>
"Aaaarrgh!!  My eyes!" screamed Big Brother.
<p>
Dr. Who heard the painful screams of Big Brother quickly receding.  "He must
have doubled back to finish off Ace," he exclaimed, nearly hulching in
disbelief and desperation.  "I think I'm going to need this," the master medic
muttered to the K.O.'d Ace as he traded his pistol for Ace's AK97,
and hoped Ace's luck would protect the
poor Ranger, for with two severely traumatized legs, he was out for the
rest of the battle.  Then it hit him:
the Brothers had preceded them through the black hole in
the New Nevada desert, as evidenced by signs--pointed out by
Mandarin--of what
must have been their escape craft that forced its way through the
vertical slits at the bottom of the black hole.
With this terrible realization, Dr. Who joined the noisy
fray, with berserk half-suicidal vengeance boiling in his arteries.
<p>
"Doctor!  Over here!"  Merp exclaimed through the din of mangler
explosions, bursts of rifle fire and the pops of electrical shorts.
She was lying on the ground
with the tripod open, emitting bursts from Shotsy.  Napalm crouched next
to her, his back braced against a panel and gun smoking.
<p>
"The Birmingham gate is straight
ahead!  But we're running out of ammo and the CPAV brigade is soon to
arrive!"
<p>
From where he crouched, Dr. Who could see that Mandarin had two
brothers pinned behind a tall cylinder, her rifle barrel spitting the last of
her Ranger-issue uranium-core armor-piercing bullets.  She signalled over to
Pretty Boy and he let one
of his last manglers fly.  The explosion, dead on target, sent the two
hidden brothers flying back head over heels into the dusty darkness.
<p>
"Yes!  Yes!" the former movie star yelled, but not very convincingly.
He held up two fingers in "V" formation to Mandarin through the dust clouds.
<p>
"Victory?  What, is Peanuts, crazy?" Napalm shouted, as his white-hot weapon
barrel melted, useless after expending his last clip.  "We'll never win
without ammo!"
<p>
"Uh, Nape, I think he means he has two RPG's left, and that's it!" Merp said
nervously.  She couldn't even see what she was plugging holes in, and
the noise of flying shrapnel and bullets and explosions disoriented her.
Chack-chack "Oh great, Shotsy's shot!" she said severely.
<p>
Mandarin's keen senses noted that their adversaries had stopped attacking
back.  She doubled back to Dr. Who, Napalm and Merp, who were huddling over
Shotsy.  Pretty Boy followed suit, and soon they were all sheltered behind a
pockmarked metal tower of bundled wires.  "Uh, Doc, we're all outta the
conventional ammo, and Pretty Boy only has two rockets left!"
<p>
Mandarin looked very concerned.
<p>
"OK, switch to rail weaponry.  By the way, we've lost Ace for the time being,"
Dr. Who said, informing them of their status, "and guess who we're
fighting."
<p>
"RANGERS!!!" shouted a gruff voice--the voice of death incarnate,
thought Pretty Boy.  "Ohh shhh...."
<p>
The towering figure of Big Brother stood up from the wreckage as dust
billowed around him, his cape flapping in the laminar air flow.  His
stance revealed
a rage that the Rangers were all too familiar with: his holy war stance.
<p>
"I think we're in big trouble," Mandarin whispered.
<p>
"RANGERS!  You have transgressed one last time!  And now you will
pay with your worthless lives for the desecration of Citadelian property!
I've been waiting years for this moment, when I shall personally gloat in the
spilling of Ranger guts all over this accursed world of machinery.
RANGERS!  You sniveling, muck-raking, foul-smelling, peon-brained, unworthy
sacks of rad-rat fodder!  Come out and fight!  Have
you gone cartilaginous on us, Infidels?  Our powered assault armor has
absorbed the feeble brunt of your best efforts!!"
<p>
"Try absorbin' this rookie!"  At Napalm's signal, the Rangers let Big Brother
have it with style.  The combined punch of their electromagnetically
accelerated molten projectiles and an RPG right on target
("Yes!  Yes!") courtesy of Pretty Boy,
knocked Big Brother off his pedestal and threw up a tremendous explosion
and dust cloud, under which cover they raced toward the Birmingham gateway.
<p>"Going somewhere, Ranger meat?"  Brother Dave suddenly swung about in full
view of the retreating party, brandishing his energy weapon.  KZACK!!
Before anyone could react, angry quarks jumped from his gun and grazed
Pretty Boy and slammed into Merp knocking her unconscious against a hard
metallic bunker.
<p>"Citadelian SLIME SUCKER!" Napalm yelled in blind rage at seeing
violence done
to Merp.  Excalibur hurtled through the air before he realized he had
the reflex, finding its mark in the blinking wall near the Birmingham
gate--but not before it had
shortened Brother Dave's Meson Cannon by a few centimeters, and had
sliced its way through his armored shoulder.
"AAAAAAaaaaarrrggghhh!" the severely injured
brother screamed as he vanished into the dust clouds.
<p>
"Doc!  Merp's hit, I'm going to patch her up!" Napalm was proximally the
closest to Merp, and so rushed to her side while Dr. Who sent Mandarin and a
shaken, but
stable Pretty Boy over for cover behind another embankment.  "Give me a big
explosion, P.B.!  I need some cover to open the gate!" Dr. Who hoped
this would work. They couldn't last long on rail guns against powered armor.
"I wonder where the cavalry. . ."
<p>
"ZAKRACKABOOOOOOOOOOOOOM!!!!"  Out the
corner of his eye, Dr. Who saw more brothers flying.  "Gees, guys, great
shot!"  But then his jaw dropped.
<p>
"TANKS!  Retreat!"
<p>
Mandarin didn't need to heed Big Brother's call to marshall
his forces to safer ground.  She and Pretty Boy bucked it back toward
the gate where they could see Dr. Who hunched over the gate fiddling with
the electronics. 
<p>
"KRRRACKOOOOOM!!!"
<p>
"Aiiiiiii!" Mandarin took a good sized chunk of shrapnel in her
thigh, and went down on top of Pretty Boy.  Pretty Boy managed to squeeze out
from underneath her and carefully aimed his last RPG at the tank that was
nearly on top of them. 
<p>
"PEANUTS, FIRE!!#%@" Mandarin yelled in pain and terror.
<p>
"Just a little bit...THERE!"  Zwwooooooosh!  Pretty Boy's meticulous aim was
rewarded with a tremendous explosion as the tank exploded from the
inside, the RPG having shot right up the big ten-centimeter gun barrel.
<p>
"YES!  YES!!!  Mandarin, take my shoulder, let's get out of here!!"
Pretty Boy dumped his empty rocket launcher and helped Mandarin to safety
before she fainted from loss of blood.  "Uh, Doc, it's Mandarin!"
<p>
Dr. Who immediately rushed to his longtime friend's side.  "Pretty
Boy, you've got point, here, take my rail gun.  I think we've just gained some
time with those tanks taking on the Brothers.  Mandy, hang in there."
She was a bloody mess, but she'd been through worse.
He would need time to stabilize her condition, though.
<hr width=50%>
"Brother Sister, stop cowering and go in there and fight, you half-wit!"
bellowed Brother Maynard, crouching behind a blinking board of circuitry.  The
battle was not going well ever since the tanks rolled in.  Brother Dave
was already permanently incapacitated, with a ten-centimeter hole right
through his torso.  Poor guy.  He'd wanted to lose a little weight,
but not like this.  First Excalibur, then a blue heat ray compliments of CPAV.
Well, he'd never suffer a bad ratings day again.
<p>
"NNnnnnnnn, I sure hate fighting.  C'mon, we finished the Rangers, now let's
just go home."  Brother Sister threw down her laser carbine and pouted.
<p>
"Oh, this is just too much," Brother Maynard thought.
He whipped his head around the wall and
zapped a few leptons into the approaching tanks.  They could fire away
at them all night, but they were too numerous.
<p>
KZACK, KZACKZAP!!  "Yatah!"  Big Brother leaped over to Maynard out of
nowhere.  "Brother, it's time to unleash the fury of our forefathers."
<p>
"You don't mean..." Brother Maynard shook his head in disbelief.
<p>
"YES!!  Maynard!  On my signal. . .  THE HOLY HANDGRENADE!!"  It was Big
Brother ordering out of the din of battle for the most awesome explosive
might ever known to exist in the New Nevadan wastes.  Never before called
forth, but constantly battle tested and examined, the holy handgrenade was
indeed a weapon to behold. 
<p>
And that, Brother Maynard did upon depressing the button on his collar to
materialize the handgrenade from its resting place in subspace.
<p>
"Wow!"
<p>
"NOW!"
<p>
"And HOW!"  And with that, Maynard skipped the counting, set the proximity
fuse to "blast to bits" and lobbed the live egg of doom toward his foes.
"Ahhhh just look at it fly!"
<p>
"Book it Brothers!" Big Brother yelled over his shoulder.
<p>
The explosion that followed not only destroyed the tanks, but also
blasted them into bits and pieces, threw them fifty yards distant,
vaporized them, and mercilessly littered their molecules throughout the arena.
Oh, and it also knocked Brother Sister
out cold with the fury of the blast, because he was a pacifist, and the holy
handgrenade, being the consummate weapon of war, didn't go for that.
<hr width=50%>
"Doc, I'm LOSING her!!"  Napalm's fledgling medic skills just could not help
Merp anymore.  She was in respiratory distress and shock, and all he
could do was hold her and yell to the master medic.  "DOC!!  Hurry!!"
<p>
Dr. Who slid over to Napalm and Merp.  His face was white with worry. 
Mandarin's prognosis was 50%, no matter how well he managed to stabilize
her.  The radiation wound in Merp's side was critical.  Napalm looked
pleadingly at Dr. Who, his 320 pound frame heaving with emotion.
<p>
"This is it, eh Doc?  I mean, we're gonna die, huh Doc?"
<p>
"Napalm, get a grip, we're not going to die.  OK I need 30 cc's of anti-rad
serum, hypo, got it?"  Dr. Who was working so intently on their newfound
comrade that the crash took him by surprise.
<p>
BOOOOM!!  "Ooof!"  A towering cylinder fell with a deafening crunch, and
Pretty Boy found himself pinned helplessly underneath.  "My legs!!
Nape!  Look out!"
<p>
"Don't move Ranger scum!"  But Napalm couldn't move anyway without jarring
Merp and potentially wounding her.  He could only watch in horror as Big
Brother ran over Pretty Boy, with his laser rifle trained on Dr. Who.
Besides it was hard doing much of anything but swallowing with Brother
Maynard holding his Proton Axe millimeters away from his throat.
He never could figure out how the brothers moved so swiftly.
<p>
"D&#233j&#225 vu, bon homme!  Back away slowly from the girl!"  Big Brother
had Dr.  Who right where he wanted him.  He was going to savor every moment of
this: his final revenge.  He picked up Dr. Who by his collar and lifted him
up with one arm, so that he was dangling four feet above the ground.
<p>
"Uh, Napalm, don't try anything heroic, let me reason with the Brothers."
<p>
"REASON?  HAAAAA-haha-HA!  Why good doctor, have you been reading your
philosophy lately?  Let me tell you about MY philosophy.  Hang in there
and listen! HAAAAA-hahahaha-HAAAA-hahah!"
 
<hr width=50%>

<p>The din of battle had been a white noise to the feverish Ace.  He was
feeling a bit dizzy from the pain killer Dr. Who must have given him, so as
long as the noise kept up, and produced no new stimuli, he felt better just
lying there dreaming of hot desert babes who spat in the dust and did push-ups
before every battle.  But lo and behold, the noise had stopped.
The lack of noise was a sensory alarm buzzer to Ace, and he pulled himself up
in a leaning position against the top of the ganglion of wires
he found himself behind.
<p>
"Big Brother???"  From where he was halfway across the dusty, dimly lit DoD
arena, Ace could see Dr. Who's tell-tale spindly figure dangling in mid
air--no being lifted up by a powerful figure that vaguely resembled Big
Brother, whom he'd met before in previous encounters with Jax Yllandian's
Ranger party.  "How'd he get here???"  In his dazed state, the sounds of
Big Brother's insults wafting over the DoD arena brought back memories.
Too weak to fight the emotional pain of remembering friends lost, Ace let
his mind drift.  Dr. Who would have to hang on a bit longer.  Good
ol' Jax.  Jax and Christina were pretty inseparable, but when he was
lost, Christina became a hard shell of a woman.
Over the past few months, Christina had opened up
to Ace, and Ace had been the best friend she'd had since Jax had been gone. He
could have sworn that she actually cared for him.  Christina was dead now.
Dead now.  dead now. . . .
<p>
"And now, sniveling little Ranger, you, and your measly friends
will all DIE!!!!"
<p>
Big Brother's raging insults had built up to a fevered pitch, and now he was
at the climax of his terrible invectives.  Ace knew he had to do something to
save the Doctor.  But what?  Suddenly he looked down at his right hand,
which was clutching a bulge in his flak vest pocket.  Christina's gift!!
<p>
All this time Ace did not realize what she had hurled at him at the last
second before the Wasteland<font size=1>TM</font> got kasploded.
But now, his memories of their past Citadel
conquest came flooding back.  Now he knew.  He took out the small gray
object and pointed it in Big Brother's direction.  He had a ghost of a
chance at this range of hitting him, and his unsteady hand shook violently
with the strain of concentration. 
<p>
"This one's for you Chris." And he depressed the button.
<p> 
<center><strong>LITERARY SUPER SLO-MO DEATH-CAM:</strong></center>
A pencil-thin beam of single-frequency, high intensity photons streaks
outward from Christina's grey box at light speed, but hits a bunker at
an oblique angle and gets reflected down to the floor.  Miraculously,
the light beam lands right onto the severed end of a bundle of fiber optics
cables.  The lethal dose of laser radiation winds its way down toward the
Birmingham gate, bouncing along happily inside the cables and exits at
another breach in the cable with a low-angle trajectory
that takes it near the Birmingham gate where it finds Excalibur and
glints off her shiny blade stuck in the wall, finally coming to rest in the
small of Big Brother's back, instantly paralyzing him as his finger was
tightening on the trigger, and dropping a startled Dr. Who to the ground on
top of the killer Brother of the Citadel. 
<p>
"Oooff!"
<p>
<center><strong>BACK TO NORMAL SPEED</strong></center>
Napalm quickly took advantage of the surprising situation and reversed
Brother Maynard's axe into his helmet, and gave him a splitting
headache.  Literally.  He gently let go of Merp, who'd luckily just been
stabilized by the Doctor, just as Big Brother had yanked him upwards.
<p>
"Doc!  You OK?  You're OK.  Pretty Boy, how many times have I had to pull
your butt out from underneath steel girders?  Don't answer,
buddy, just crawl out in one piece."
<p>
Napalm heaved the huge column off Pretty Boy's legs.
<p>
"Nape, you big ape, my legs are broken.  I'll never dance again.  My fans will
hurl themselves from the highest bridges.  Women everywhere will gnash
their teeth and cry for weeks.  No, months!  No, . . ."
<p>
"At least you got your cutesy little face, you runt.  Doc!  Pretty
Boy's having delusions of grandeur again."
<p>
"Give him some peanut butter, Nape," Dr. Who said, half-smirking.  "Always
shuts the little bugger up," he thought, as he toured the carnage and
checked up on his team.  "Merp's stable, Mandarin's resting, Pretty Boy'll
live.  Hmm, Ace.  A shot like that was pretty darn lucky. . . .  I
wonder. . . .  Napalm, I'm going to find Ace! Get everybody to the gate,
and hang tight, oh, and see if you can't set Pretty Boy's legs."
<p>
"Bark!  Grrrrr!  Bark bark!!"  Merp's little dog Chip suddenly appeared with a
ripped patch of tell-tale Citadelian jeans in his jowls, and led Napalm
to Brother Sister, who was regaining consciousness.  Chip spit out the
blue-jean fragment on Brother Sister's face.  "Watch it Chip he's dangerous.
Or she?  Or. . . heck, Brother, what you say you at you is anyway?"
Chip, uninterested, walked away happily, nose in the air and wagging his
little tail.
<p>
"Nnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn"
<p>
"Oh shut up.  You confuse me."  KONK!  And Napalm silenced him/her, not
realizing the gravity of his action in preventing the world from ever
knowing Brother Sister's sex.
<p>
"Dr. Who, over here," Ace feebly spoke.  The pain killers were starting to
wear off, and he was lapsing in and out of half-sleep.
Dr. Who rushed over to the prone figure.
<p>
He saw the gray rectangular Derringer laser pistol nearby, it's energy
cell spent on one well-aimed blast.  "Ace!  It was you!!  That shot was one
in a million!"
<p>
"One in five quadrillion, two hundred thousand, but who's counting. . . .
take me to the nearest party, Doc!"  With that the world's luckiest Ranger
collapsed into a sedated sleep, and Dr. Who carried him to the Birmingham
gate, where Napalm had already assembled the others.
<p>
"Dr. Who, I think I've managed to get the gateway opened.  I'm going to put
you into the spool for your user, Ben," Merp struggled to straighten up,
but Napalm gestured her not to.  She had gained consciousness during the past
few minutes, and refused more sedation so that she could attempt to open the
gate.
<p>
"Shhhh Merp.  Take it easy!  You're coming with us," Napalm said, bending
down and moving her mottled hair back from her face with the side of his
meaty hand.  Chip barked and licked her fingers.
<p>
"I--I don't know Napalm.  I--I wouldn't fit in.  I wouldn't want
to burden--"
<p>
"Merp, stop that nonsense.  Your home is with us now.  You have five new
friends in us, and we'd never desert you!"  Dr. Who could tell Napalm
agreed.  In fact when Merp finally nodded in consent, it was all Napalm
could do to keep himself from shouting jubilantly, and even then,
he jumped up and dented the ceiling inside the gateway.
<p>
"Hmmm.  I did dent it!"
<p>
"Let's go home crew!"  Dr. Who said, his voice finally showing signs of
fatigue.
<p>
"WAIT!" Napalm suddenly remembered.
<p>
"Nape, what is it?" Pretty Boy exclaimed, but Napalm answered with his actions,
and yanked out Excalibur from the wall by the gate.  It oozed with the blood of
victory.
<p>
"Ahhhhh. . ."  With a blur of muscles and tendons, Napalm polished the knife
to a sheen brighter than the bald head of--naw, we already used that
comparison--and after a flamboyant routine of swirls and twirls amid his
dexterous fingers, the blade finally rung with a schwing of metallic
happiness.  "Groovy. . .  NOW we can go," Nape said admiring his weapon.
<p>
Dr. Who helped his battered Rangers between the glowing slits of the
Birmingham gateway, without as much as a glance behind him.

<hr>
<strong>Chapter the Last<br>
"eee-chu-tah": Birmingham, Fall 1991</strong>
<p>

"Hmmm.  I wonder if I have any mail."  Ben put his pencil down, mentally
swearing to finish that Analytic Geometry and Calculus III problem
later, and swiveled his chair 180 to face his computer.  He thought about
the argument he was currently prolonging on the Matrix BBS, and wondered what
kind of snide remarks Johansen Barcalay had made in response to Ben's last
comments.  They were arguing on the TREK conference about Wesley Crusher's
worth as a life form.  Ben's estimate: Romulan disrupter target material.
<p>
All the lines were busy to the BBS, however, which wasn't surprising since it
was prime time BBSing hours (<i>viz.</i> early evening).  So he decided to call
the school's mainframe and see what was happening there.
Maybe his roommate would be on line,
and then Ben could dump a colorful-metaphoric message to Scott's
terminal, wherever he may be on campus.  "Ah, yes.  The beauty of the HP9000,"
he muttered to himself.
<p>
He logged on, typed in his password, and a message was displayed just before
his prompt appeared: "You have mail."
<p>
"I wonder who that could be."  Ben connected to the HP9000's e-mail system
and found in his mailbox a most peculiar "envelope," or message title.
It read, plain and simple, "jf%^@516eee-chu-tah!!!."
<p>
"How rude!" Ben thought.  He brought up the message to his view
screen, and saw more of the same garble as the title, although somewhat less
rude.  Interestingly enough, however, he recognized some of the ASCII codes
in the mail, which he now believed to be a data file.
<p>
"Fascinating!" he Orac-ed to himself.  He set up for a Kermit download, and
dumped the crudely named file to his hard drive.  He quickly exited the
e-mail program, and logged off, but not before a message flashed across his
screen courtesy of Scott: "SMEG HEAD!"
Ben vowed revenge, but focused his attention on more
important things, namely, what he had a hunch would be the recovery of a
noble band of lost desert Rangers!
<p>
He pulled out his disk box, and located the
Wasteland<font size=1>TM</font>/Fountain of Dreams<font size=1>TM</font>
diskette, and jammed it into his computer.  In his haste, he knocked
over the disk box and it fell to the floor, scattering its contents.
He looked down briefly: "Hmm.  Didn't even dent it."
<p>
Ben switched drives, installed the game, and even copied over the "Bad file on
disk" he thought he had ruined forever.  He then attempted a merge of the "Bad"
files he'd saved for posterity's sake with the data files he'd just
discovered sitting in his spool-mail box.  Cracking his knuckles,
he sighed heavily.  Ben typed at the C prompt: "wl" and waited nervously.
<p>
<center><strong>Move to Wasteland, 1998</strong></center>
<p> 
Napalm had seen Kirk and his away teams do it many times, but never in his
wildest dreams had he imagined transporting anywhere.  But that is what
it felt like, and he even thought he heard the funky "beaming" sounds.
Actually, it was Chip whining due to a bad case of dizziness.
Besides, Chip and Merp had never before left
the grid, and it was a weird experience for them both.
<p>
It wasn't long before he was looking at home!  Ranger Center, New Nevada!!  Or
what was left of it.  Sheesh.  Things had rapidly deteriorated in their
absence. Looked like the base had been ground zero for a nuke.
Dr. Who plowed around the wreckage looking for clues.
<p>
"Medical supplies have been looted.  Hey, what's this?" Who held up a note
that read "Moved HQ to Citadel.  Rangers."
<p>
"So they all didn't die after all.  This is strange," Dr. Who thought.
<p>
"Like, wow, we kick their butts in the grid, and then steal their base!"
Pretty Boy said into Napalm's neck, being the only direction he could face
with Napalm carrying him on his back.
<p>
"Cool dude, great place to have a par. . . ."  Ace slipped back into
unconsciousness.
<p>
Napalm, we've got to get the wounded some decent medical supplies.  We have
no choice but to trek it to the Citadel."  With that, the Rangers hiked
out the door and into the glowing desert wastes.  The hot wind buffeted their
tired frames, and the relentless Sun poured out its radiant energy with a
certain welcome intensity to Dr. Who.  They indeed had returned home.
<p>
"I love this place!" Ace mumbled.
<hr>
<strong>Epilogue<br>
Tribute: Citadel, Winter 1998</strong>
<p>
 
"I can't dance. . . ."  The metallic sounds of Phil Collins drifted over the
loudspeakers of the new Ranger HQ at the only substantial edifice
dedicated to law and order left standing in the Wasteland.
Napalm, whose idea it was to play the music, never let Pretty Boy hear the
end of his delusions of grandeur, but in fact,
the former star was making a remarkable recovery.
<p>
"Guts.  It's what we've got to have a lot of around here."
Jax had said that once.  It was so true.
<p>
"Hey y'all, come see the Mayor's display!"  Merp proudly called from the newly
established Hall of Fame wing.  Everybody dropped what they were doing and
converged on Merp's display.  Everybody except Napalm--he took Excalibur, which
he was polishing (what else?), with him.
<p>
Ace was the last to show up.  He passed Jax's display, Taran Cyberpunk's,
Shinto, Allestro, Ellisande, Mad Dog, Metal Maniac (sir!).  All his old
friends.  Dead or presumed so.  A lot had changed over the years, and he
felt twenty years older than he should be.  He paused silently at
Christina's display: her retired badge number and pull-up bar.
<p>
"So we've come full circle now, eh Chris?" he thought, failing to
suppress an urge to wonder if she had actually perished in the
Wasteland<font size=1>TM</font> purge.
<p>
"Alright, Merp, show us what you got!" Pretty Boy hobbled closer.
<p>
"OK, voil&#225!"  Merp flipped the spotlight switch, and there it was, right
next to Christina's display: Mayor Peydros' license plate, reading "Meximelt."
<p>
"Merp, that's sick," Ace spat.
<p>
"Oh come on, it was the only possession the Mayor left behind.  We have to
have something to remember him by on display!"  Merp was close to tears.  She
had grown fond of the Mayor in those hard days in the Grid.  She had seen
him die.
<p>
Napalm put his ham-hocks on her shoulders, massaging them.  "It's OK Merp,
you did good."
<p>
"Oh Nape," she said with a stunted sigh.
<p>
"Merp, it's an excellent display, I'm sure the Mayor would have appreciated
it," Dr. Who reassured her, and silently reflected on Las Vegas' last great
leader.  He felt Mandarin's fingers searching for his and grasped her hand
on instinct, before pulling back.  She held him there though, and he
caught a glimpse of her glistening cheek in his peripheral vision.
Dr. Who wondered why he was feeling the way he was,
but it all felt second-nature to him.  Like he'd been there before.
Their common memory of the Mayor was acting as a catalyst for the remembrance
of other shared times, somehow forgotten.
<p>
Suddenly, Mandarin was astonished by the firmness of Drake's grip, the
warmth in it.  How long had she missed his touch?  If this adventure had
done anything, maybe it had jarred a few memory cells loose in his jumbled
brain.  She felt the tears, but showed no other emotion.  There was hope,
she thought.

<p>
Ace looked at the camera with a smug smirk and winked, knowing he had the
last words in this tale too: "Uh, guys, I'm sure Peydros appreciates his
memorial, but he wouldn't like us burning the enchiladas. . . ."
