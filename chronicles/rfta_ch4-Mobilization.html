Chapter 4 - Mobilization

<p>
The small procession walked down what was a main street of sorts, running all the way from the perimeter fence to a huge metal door set into the side of the cliff. Jerrek was in the middle of the group, and everybody was keeping a close eye on him 
with the exception of Loki.

<p>
Jerrek hardly noticed this however, as he was too busy watching the bustle and activity going on all around him. This place was huge. Having lived in a village of no more than 40 people, the sight of so many people in one place was a totally new 
thing to him. He'd heard of places such as the city of Cortez where thousands of people lived, but those were only stories to him. 

<p>
Loki just grinned and shook his head as Jerrek looked around, mouth agape.

<p>
"For god's sake Jerrek, don't attract too much attention to yourself. I'm in enough trouble as it is."

<p>
Jerrek made a point of snapping his mouth shut and trying his best to continue looking about without making it too obvious.

<p>
After a bit of walking, they approached a large canvas tent which he was directed to enter, followed by Loki, Raisa, and another man who had an assault rifle slung over his back. The others dispersed with quick goodbyes.

<p>
The tent was filled mostly with long benches and tables, one end of it filled with various bits of cooking equipment, most of them in use by a number of people rushing about and preparing food for the evening meal.

<p>
"Have a seat, Jerrek." Raisa said, gesturing to one of the few tables that had chairs, not benches, around it. "Tammy, be a dear and bring us some food."

<p>
One of the older looking cooks nodded to her and quickly set about gathering up some food, sharply reprimanding any of the other cooks who failed to quickly jump into action.

<p>
All of them sat down at  the table, except for the man with the rifle, who simply stood and watched them all, especially Jerrek.

<p>
Raisa reclined in her seat slightly, her attention focusing on Loki.

<p>
"So, Loki, tell me exactly how you came to the realization that Jerrek here should be brought here, despite the fact that it's strictly forbidden."

<p>
Loki sighed and shifted a tad uneasily in his seat, then went about explaining the past few days events.

<p>
"Frankly Loki, I think you should've simply waited until he recovered, then had him go on his way. We hardly are managing as we are, and the last thing we need is outsiders coming to us. Not to mention the fact that revealing our location to 
outsiders is a serious breach of security." Raisa said, drumming her fingers slowly on the table's enamled surface.

<p>
"He wouldn't have lasted long, Raisa. A day or two at the most in the condition he was in." Loki stated.

<p>
Jerrek brought his hand up to his forehead to gingerly touch his injured temple. In the last few it had been reduced from a lump to a bruise. He hadn't actually had the chance to look in a mirror, but Loki said it looked pretty nasty.

<p>
"That isn't our concern," Raisa said. "The ultimate safety of the community is much more important than the life of one outsider."

<p>
Jerrek fidgeted in his seat. "Um..."

<p>
Raisa shot him a sharp look, which quickly shut his mouth.

<p>
"I don't think I was endangering anybody by bringing him here. I just have a feeling about him." Loki said, gesturing over towards Jerrek.

<p>
Raisa once again turned her calculating eyes on Jerrek, and he squirmed a bit under the scrutiny. That woman could make a deathclaw uneasy!

<p>
"Alright, he can stay." She said after staring him down for a considerable length of time.

<p>
Jerrek almost wasn't sure if he was glad to hear that.

<p>
"But," she said suddenly, breaking his train of thought. "There are a few things you need to know."

<p>
Jerrek nodded.

<p>
"First off, Loki here will supervise you for the time being. You are not to leave his sight, unless you're told otherwise directly by me."

<p>
Jerrek nodded and glanced to Loki, who looked less than pleased at that.

<p>
"You mean I have to be his watchdog? In case you didn't notice, I just got back from three weeks of scouting, and I'm not in the mood to be on my feet anymore."

<p>
Raisa regarded him calmly, a cold look on her face. "Loki, you have nobody to blame but yourself. You're the one that brought him here, remember? Also, I don't appreciate your questioning an order like that." she sighed and shook her head slightly. 
"No matter how far we might go back, that doesn't change the fact that I am the Overseer, and my duties come first before everything else. Got that?" Loki nodded in aknowledgement, seemingly humbled. 

<p>
"Secondly you are not to leave, or even approach the perimeter fence. If you do, you'll be shot. Understood?"

<p>
Jerrek blinked a few times, dumbly nodding his head.

<p>
"Good. If you have any questions, you should ask Loki here. Within reason, of course." she gave a somewhat harsh look in his direction. Loki wilted just a little bit more.

<p>
At this point the head cook, Tammy, returned carrying three bowls of some kind of meaty stew, informing them that they should eat it before it gets cold. Loki started right in on his, muttering about how hungry he was. Jerrek was just as hungry but 
he held off, waiting for Raisa to start first. The least he could do was try to have manners.

<p>
Much to his chagrin, she simply stared at her food, then pushed it away. Apparently she wasn't hungry. Jerrek took this as a sign to dig in.

<p>
It was the best food he'd had in months, not including when his aunt cooked him some dog stew.

<p>
His aunt. Whom he'd never see again. His spoon was forgotten for a moment as he fought to contain the memories. It wouldn't do to start breaking down in front of everybody.

<p>
"You do, of course, know that we'll never be able to let you leave." Raisa said suddenly, breaking his revere. Jerrek's eyes opened wide.

<p>
"Ya-- Who? Me? Why?" He stammered out. This definitely wasn't what he had in mind for the rest of his life. He shot a quick glance over towards Loki, who continued eating his stew as if nothing unusual was happening.

<p>
"How are we to know if you'd reveal our location? Either voluntarily or not. That's a risk that we can't take, I'm afraid."

<p>
Jerrek just shook his head. This wasn't happening.

<p>
"Jerrek, I'm sorry." Raisa said, with what Jerrek assumed was genuine regret. "But look at it this way, at least you'll be safe with us."

<p>
He returned to eating his stew mechanically, not finding anything to say.

<p>
********

<p>
Defiler wound his way through the crowded hallways, sometimes almost being forced to brush against the metal walls by large groups of warriors, priming their gear and talking excitedly amongst each other. Normally this would be unexcusable, but he 
let it slide for the sole reason that when you were preparing for war, some alterations to tradition were required.

<p>
Finally he approached the door to his chambers, he saw the small laser emit from the small lens set next to the door, scanning his retina to make sure that he was, in fact, authorized to enter this room. It seemed rather pointless to him, since no 
warrior or novice would dare enter his chambers, but it was there anyway, put in by the Vault's original manufacturer to guard against unauthorized entries.

<p>
The door whisked open with a hiss that was inaudible over the sounds of many voices in the hall. He quickly entered, and the door shut behind him, shutting out the din from the hallway.

<p>
Quietly, he made his way towards his chair, sitting down and swiveling it towards the VDU on the west wall. With a quick verbal command, the screen jumped to life, displaying the latest report.

Defiler was indeed surprised by this message. According to the warriors, all traces of life at the village were eliminated, not including the female subject that was now residing in one of the observation chambers of the medlab.

<p>
This was most interesting indeed. And potentially useful. He swiveled the chair-mounted keyboard around to rest in front of him, and typed out a reply.

Defiler grinned and punched the Y button on the keyboard. The screen blanked for a nanosecond and then returned to the main menu. He shut it off.

<p>
Definitely unexpected. But quite possibly useful. He would find out how useful soon.
