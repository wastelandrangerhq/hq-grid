<p><h3><center>Monday.  Casa Fargo, Baja, Mexico.  11:32am</center></h3><p>
Where's my gun?  Oh, there it is.
This nuclear war stuff really chaps my hide.
Metal*
<h5>*From now on, we assume the appellation ``Metal,''
``Metal Maniac'' or any other variant thereof is appended with the
honorary ``Sir!''.</h5>
and I don't even have to waste ammo potshotting the pigeons anymore.
Dinner just rains from the frakkin glowing skies.
Sure tastes funny though, like it's overdone or something.
Frak, coffee pot's busted.
<p>
Me and Metal are going to head north in a few days if this keeps up.
Everything and everybody around us is dropping like the pigeons.
Some kinda radiation thingy from the war, or something.
Metal and me, we're immune, Doc. Ortega said before he threw up on me
and died.
Something about our thick heads or something, I guess.
Pop always use to say I had a thick head.
But he got over it after I whopped up on 'im, and showed that his head
was no thicker than mine.
My first experiment, I like to think of it.
<p>
Doc's the one told us to go north to contact his pal Peydros,*
<h5>*Honore
Peydros' five year tenure as Mayor of Las Vegas endured through the
chaos of World War III and the ensuing holocaust, until Law was no
longer viable.  He dedicated his life to the ideals we uphold as
Rangers, implementing tours with Christina and ultimately myself, 
working in the field with Ranger intelligence, and even serving as 
Sheriff of Highpool for a brief recuperative stint.  
He was perhaps the most valiant and selfless Ranger that has
ever lived.  His sacrifice ensured the continuity of our mission which
remains, in his mutated Spanglish, ``To uphold Mother Justice in our
ravaged land, Keptin.''</h5>
the mayor of Vegas.
Nevada's about the safest place around what with all the wind patterns
isolating the place, and frak, it's like they forgot to bomb Vegas, or
the missiles screwed up or something.
Odds are the mayor's gotta place we can stay in and glow.
<p>
Ever since that barrage hit California a month back, everything has been
going to frak.
Glowing's been funny and all for a while, you know, like not having
to use a flashlight to clean my
gun at night, but frak, I don't wanna glow til I die.
And the cucarachas, man, they're getting bolder every day, like they're
crawling outta the bed, and starting to bite!
It ain't enough to step on them anymore.
Now I've been using my dinner ammo to clear me a path to the John at
night.
Metal swears one bit a hole in one of his grenades and blew up his tool
shed last night.
``Taught that frakkin bugger,'' he said.
I think he's got more shrapnel in his head than he lets on.

<p><h3><center> Thursday, Some deserted outpost on the border, 3:14am</center></h3><p>
I just had a thought in a dream.  All I remember was I was in a circle,
like on paper, and...  
Frak, forgot it.  Oh well, I'll just clean Suzie.  Sure could go
for a pigeon pie about now....

<p><h3><center> Tuesday, City ruins, 2:34pm</center></h3><p>
I think it's Tuesday.  My watch doesn't display the date anymore.
I sure wish we had some tortillas.
Metal's found some bottled salsa in a shop, and we're eating it plain
for lunch, even though it has cilantro in it.  I hate the weed, but
those near the border just love it in their sauce.  
Metal says it's not from around here---not New Mexican, and not Mexican;
could it be 
Arizonan?  How do you call something from Arizona anyway?  Frak, I'm
becoming a frakkin intellectual.  Metal would say he's rubbing off on me.
But he ain't no school-boy---he got his Mexican butt kicked 
outta seventh grade when he
asked his science teacher why they named the Big Bang after some
porn flick.  And he never bothered to go back.  Don't blame 'im.
<p>
All school taught me how to do was read, write, cuss and hide a
fl'echette pistol up my sleeve.  Still got it.
Call it Spade cuz it's always been my trump card.
Saved my cajones on many occasions.
Well, Pop once said school ``didn't do nobody no good.''
Pop was always busting me down with his logic.

<p><h3><center> City ruins</center></h3><p>
Lost my frakkin watch yesterday while we were getting dinner.
``Dinner'' was these meter-tall rodents with big ears and tails, and
nasty claws.
Put Suzie through a few clips of 9mm before the suckers dropped.
Dinner's getting quite hard to get these days.
Metal's gun jammed, so he's in a funk.  I told him those carbines were
flawed, but Noooo, he had to have his ``trusty rusty.''
He's off sulking somewhere.
<p>
Anyway, we've been stuck for I guess a week now
in what used to be a run-down border city even before the war.
Frak, I've kinda lost track of the weeks (months?) since we left home.
Sure miss those Pacific sunrises.
Frak, never thought I'd get sentimental over anything, not since
Lupita dissed me by running off with that <i>norteamericano</i>
plastic surgeon.
``You love your gun more than me!'' she said, snapping her face toward
me so fast her silky black hair got all tangled up in her face, and she
had to spit it outta her mouth. 
Ha, she messed up her grammar---shoulda said ``I'' insteada ``me.''
She was alway correcting my Spanglish.
I told her no way, because guns are for shooting, but women...,
frak, I forgot what came next.  Maybe I didn't say anything.
She didn't like it, whatever I said or implied, because I was such a
cocky frakkin jock back then.
Truth is, that moment, hearing my own words showed me what an idiot I
was.  I was a new man, and I wanted to take back my
stupid frakkin words so bad; I wanted her to see who I really was.
But she packed her bags and left that day.
Never saw her again.  The story of my life.
Women.  Can't live with 'em; can't waste yer ammo on 'em.

<p><h3><center> Vegas</center></h3><p>
Found Peydros today, and he's one cool dude.
This chump Faran Brygo kidnapped his wife and was threatening to blow
her up if the mayor didn't do something about the frakkin tanks that
started roaming the streets last week.
Nobody knows where they came from, but there's word about some nut named
Finster who wants to destroy humanity.
I guess he figured the war hadn't, so he might as well do the job right.
He might succeed, since those tanks are frakkin unstoppable.
<p>
Anyway, Peydros couldn't care a flip about his wife---she drove him
loco and spent his money gambling and to buy protection from (oh, will 
the irony never end?) Brygo himself.
Truth is, Peydros can't handle the town anymore since the tanks rolled
in.
Frak, if he can't even handle his wife, I don't see how this man can
handle anything.
Sure is good with a knife though---lesson #314: Never surprise
Peydros when he's armed.
He beat the wonkas outta Metal before we even realized we'd found our
Vegas contact.
Good thing Suzie was on safety, or I'd have impeached 'im, but I'm glad
I didn't cuz Peydros is one good cook!

<p><h3><center> Brygo's Brig</center></h3><p>
Well, Metal and I began wondering about what we was going to do with
ourselves, glowing and all.
So what did we do but get caught busting up some thugs on Brygo's turf
and get thrown in these lousy detention cells.
Peydros can't even get near us to spring us, on account of his wife
being the cause of most of her kidnapper's troubles:
'ol Brygo can't stand Peydros' wife (can anyone?), but he can't just
kill
her, either, so as a result of his dilemma, Brygo ordered his men to
shoot to kill if they ever see Peydros.
I understand Brygo's female troubles <i>completely</i>.
<p>
Anyway, they took all my ammo, Suzie, and even my new M1989-A1 assault
rifle Emmie, with her .45 caliber depleted uranium-core
clips and a nice Black Market laser sight I'd bought the day before.
(Mostly, I turn off the sight though, cuz it takes all the fun outta
punching holes through things.)
They don't know I still carry Spade, but with only two shots, it's not
going to be doing Metal and I any good, since there's too many of them.
<p>
Speaking of guns, it sure sucks that I have (or had) to carry around
both types of 9mm and .45 ammo, but it's worth it I guess.
Or used to be.
Metal had finally broke down and got himself an AK-97, which uses those
confounded 7.62mm clips which are always causing jams.
I told him he should rebore it and use the .45 ammo since it's so
plentiful, but Noooo, gotta be Metal, gotta disagree.
He knows it's the right thing to do, but he doesn't want to be beholden
to my ideas.
Sheesh, it's getting old, Paco.
And so is this lousy food they give us.

<p><h3><center> Quartz</center></h3><p>
Finally, we're free!
So much has happened the last few weeks to Metal and I.
First, I find out that Spade has only <i>one</i> fl'echette loaded.
I was cleaning it in the dark and felt the empty chamber.
Must have had more fun that first night in Vegas at the Royal Flush
than I remember.
<p>
Oh well, anyway, I didn't need Spade, cuz soon after that, what do you
know, but ol' Peydros himself and a bunch of vigilantes named Rangers
come crashing through the place one night and sprung us outta Brygo's
prison.
They came packin' too.
They had Uzi's and Mac-10's and even an M1989-A1 like Emmie (which I got
back, with a full pack of clips!).
<p>
Peydros told Metal he left his mayoral job and joined the Rangers to
continue his quest for another Justice, or something like that.
They were in the neighborhood, and decided to spring us.
Evidently the Rangers formed up to keep some kind of order in Vegas, but
they don't seem to be doing a very good job.
This here's Brygo's turf, and they declared outright war on him by
springing us.
At any rate, it seems we're gonna leave Brygo enough alone, and
concentrate on tackling Finster, whose tanks are killing people right
and left in Vegas, and now they're spreading to Needles too.
<p>
Well, now we're holed up in this leaky shack in a dumpy city south of
Vegas, waiting for the Mayor's flak wounds to firm up, and waiting out the
rainy season (a big frakkin week!) and this gringa Christina*

<h5>*The able-bodied Christina (she went only by this name) was a valuable
as well as valiant member of my Ranger troop before the purge, where she
is assumed to have met her Waterloo.  It was Christina's
Citadellian laser derringer that she hurled to Ace before the closure of
the Hole, and that ultimately was our ticket back to the Wasteland
from Cyberspace (via Ace's phenomenal luck).  May Christina rest in
peace.</h5>

is telling us stories of the first Rangers between spits
into a can.
She sure is hung up on this Indian named Jacks*[sic].

<h5>*The famed Ranger
leader, Jax Yllandian of Acoma Puebla, is arguably our George Washington.
Having escaped the Wasteland into Cyberspace, he has since
contacted us via the Hole, and tells us he is alive and well at some
institution of higher learning in that strange world.</h5>

Says that he's gotta be alive since he scribbled the word ``CLONE'' in
the sand before he fried from radiation.
Christina may be missing the chicken in her enchiladas.
<p>
The wierdest one of the crew is the guy named Taran*.

<h5>*Taran
``The Wanderer'' Luthen was Jax's longtime friend from the American States.
Having escaped quite
accidentally from the Wasteland before the purge with Jax, he's now
doing fine in Cyberspace.  It is my theory that Jax and Taran's return
to the Wasteland would create a temporal anomaly and wipe the Rangers
here now from existence, by rewriting the ASCII file encoding
all the Rangers, and by reinitializing the status of the Wasteland to
the point in time when Jax and Taran had left---an occurrence, which
evidence suggests, happened when my party returned to the Wasteland.</h5>

He's not human, I swear, and he's always making clicking noises with his
neck when he turns his head.
He's evidently a good medic though, and he took out three thugs with one
burst in the fight.  Never seen that done before.
<p>
Metal's taken a liking to the other woman, Ellisond Lendwind*[sic.],

<h5>Ellisande Llendwynn was the American founding Ranger whose
heroic actions (in concert with Taran) in the battle with Finster were
rewarded with the inaugural Ranger Medallion.</h5>

but she couldn't give a flip for Paco, he's so smelly and all.
Besides, I can tell she's only got eyes for Taran.
I tell you one thing, though (frak, who'm I talking to anyway?),
Taran can handle a gun, but he sure can't handle women.
Three years ago, I woulda said ``yes'' to Ellisond if I was in T's
shoes, but then I'd probably say something stupid, and rack up another
failure in the female department.  I was like that, back before
Lupita changed me for the better.
I like T, even if he's a bit quirky: he's not interested in frivolous
love-games, and as far as I think, he's doing the best thing.
<p>
Well, gotta go, since Ace*,

<h5>Ace Maloney, the self-proclaimed
Ranger ``party dude,'' is perhaps the luckiest man alive.  Currently
stationed in Vegas, Ace single-handedly brought down the leader of the
Citadellian exiles in Cyberspace with a ``one-in-a-million'' (first
approximation) shot from Christina's pilfered laser derringer,
and in doing so increased my life span, earning him the Ranger 
Medallion (for terminating Big Brother,
not for saving my derriere...).</h5>

the Rangers' loco helicopter
pilot, is throwing this party at a local joint for no apparent reason,
and Paco'll drink all the beer if I don't get there in time.

<p><h3><center> Outside Base Cochise </center></h3><p>

``Chew Deuterium, Finster!''
That cipher key says it all.  Ever since we've discovered that Brygo and
other militant factions in New Nevada (that's what they're calling
post-holocaust Nevada, but there's nothing new about it) are
intercepting our communications, we've had to resort to encrypting our
radio waves.  Since paper's expensive, I'm now using this code book as
my diary.  Stuffed the old pages into the pocket in the front cover.
Kills two rad rats with one burst.  Now when I memorize the next
day's codes at night, I add a little bit to this.  I don't know why
I write, but it's in my genes, said Pop.  His dad wrote some memoirs,
and I really enjoyed reading them as a child.  Pop never could read, so
I guess the genes skipped a generation.  Kind of sad I had to leave it
behind in Mexico.
<p>
It's been a good long week after we ransacked Darwin Station looking for
Finster tracks.  We now know the big F is an android!  Got a good look
at the spindly little dude during the fight.  Talk about a
strange world.  Even T looked excited.  But that's another story.  Frak,
I just hope the big F's still sliceable and diceable, cuz I'm gonna fill
that metal carcass of his full of white-hot lead-incased depleted uranium.
Frakkin robot.  ``Can't trust anything mechanical,'' says Metal.  He
should try cleaning his gun every once and a while.
<p>
Last time we thought we had Finster down in the D.S. cloning
labs (Christina, darn her, always looking for Jax and gettin' us in 
trouble), he called out his octobots (``Octobots, roll out!'' he 
screams.  What an idiot!  The frakkin drones don't even have wheels!), 
and they pretty much gave us a run for our pesos, while the big F 
slipped away.  Good thing
we weren't packing light that day, but even as it was, the good Mayor
got his Mexican butt kicked all over the building.  He said with an
insane grin, that he's never felt
so exhilirated since the '88 vermin skirmishes of Quartz!  
Peydros is back at HQ recuperating.  I also nearly melted Emmie's
muzzle firing too many bursts one after the other.  I have a feeling now
how hot those Vulcan chopper gatling guns get, the ones Ace is always 
drooling about in his more serious moments.  Some day I gotta get me 
one of those.
<p>
Anyway, now we're encamped right outside of the so-called Base Cochise,
where Taran's finally picked up Finster's scent again.  I don't know if
T can really smell Finster or what, but he sure can pick up a trail.
Sometimes I wonder if he's actually more like Finster than I'd like to
think.  I'd hate to have him on the other side in a fight.  His reflexes
make the <i>Mayor</i> blink!  We're to infiltrate the compound
later on tonight to see what frakkin F is up to.
<p>
Ellisande's just about to pop with
frustration over T, which is fine with me, cuz she's getting on my
nerves, always trying to catch his attention.  One time Taran actually
asked her a question, and she went stone-like, just
standing there fiddling with her flak-vest zipper, but when she didn't
answer, T just walked away.  What a <i>dis</i>!  Maybe T doesn't notice
her, or maybe he does and does what any sane man would do and ignores 
it.  Sheesh, some women just don't get it.
<p>
Ellis seems so cardboard-ish, like those swimsuit cal-girls back at HQ.
You never get to know who they really are.  It's kinda ironic Metal
keeps insisting he's seen her as Miss November of some year.  It may be
his wishful thinking, but it sure would fit the brain scenario.
Frak, even Christina with
her one-track (Jax) mind has more of a third dimension than Ellis.
But I can understand Chris somewhat.
A little piece of me still stings from Lupita's last dagger-words.
Losing someone so close hurts you like the ``dickens,'' whatever that 
is, but Ace is always saying it, and it sounds
cool.  Frak, I hear Chris lost her entire Ranger party to radiation!
Chris hides them pretty well with her scowl and her dedication to her
work, but I can tell she's got
some feelings still left, and she ain't all cold steel exterior like
she's made herself out to be.  Whoever Jax was, he was one lucky
Indian.
But I just don't understand the other woman.

<p><h3><center> Highpool </center></h3><p>

It's been a while since Metal exploded Finster like a blood sausage in
the deuterium-water pool, and I'm still having flashbacks.  
Man, what a fight!  Emmie proved to be very
handy!  Paco's never glowed brighter.  It's gotten to the
point that he gets little sleep because his eyelids glow, and it's like
sleeping with the light on, only you can't shut your eyes.  T says it'll
fade with time, but I'm wondering what time means to T.  I mean, after
all, he's a cyborg, and God knows how long he'll live.  Oh yeah, that
final confrontation with the frakkin F really revealed alot.  Ellisande's
a little bit turned off by T now, even after her crazy little show at
Base Cochise, but I bet Metal my last clip of hollow-points that she'd
be back to her old tricks in a week.  And would
you believe Chris finally found her Jax?  Or a copy of him.  I'm not
sure how it worked, but Jax and T got cloned by Finster, and F actually
experimented on T, turning him into a cyborg, and was going to do the
same with Jax, but Metal really fixed that scrawny punk robot for
good, before he could mess up Jax's good looks. 
In fact, T actually <i>died</i> in the radiowastes near Darwin Station
along with Jax, after running from an ambush of mutant motorcycles, of
all things.  That's when Christina lost her crew.  But somehow, frakkin 
F got a holda Jax's and T's blood and cloned the guys, and so finally
Christina's happy, and we can all rest.
<p>
Back at HQ, we got a hero's banquet.
Jax was very warmly received, as was T, with some reserve.  
People just don't trust T the same as they used to, I guess.  
Metal's outright cold to him.  He's still on our side, I constantly 
remind myself, counting my blessings,
but he sure gave us a scare at Base Cochise, when 
we heard frakkin F order him to betray us.  
That was a few of the tensest moments I've ever survived!
<p>
Now we're at this little college town called Highpool because of its
glacial lake that's laced with a natural chemical stimulant.  Kinda
tastes like Carbo-Cola, but anyways, it's mildly addictive, and thus
the name.  Ace swears by it, but I can tell he's a bit disappointed.
Evidently not as much kick as a snake squeezin.  Well, we're here on a
routine patrol of the desert, and what do you know, but Peydros is here!  
I was wondering where he'd gone after we purged Darwin Station.
He's got himself elected again---this time as Sheriff.  I guess he found 
another justice, like he's always saying.  But anyway, it's nice to see
the good Mayor again, even if he's no longer a Ranger, or a Mayor for
that matter.  Frak, I guess I shouldn't call him that anymore. 
<p>
Peydros told me that Vegas is under a new threat now.  The college kids
are disappearing right and left in that sleazy city on their weekly
casino runs (evidently Highpool U. is a boring place on the weekends).
The Mayor thinks it's some new group of punks openly advertising
themselves as The Citadel, and masquerading (?) as a religious group
that's promising order in the Wasteland chaos, but who really are 
abducting innocent kids, and who knows what's happening to them.  
<p>
We actually saw a few Citadellian propaganda posters in Vegas last time
we were there.  They pictured this huge man in a billowing hood and cloak
standing akimbo, legs far apart (Ace calls it ``The Holy War Stance''),
and the words in bold red, ``The Citadel: A Haven of Hope for Humans in 
Havoc.'' Jax, Chris and Ace even ran across a one 
Brother Biggs*[sic] 

<h5>*Big Brother was the
leader of the Citadellian foursome who escaped to Cyberspace before the
purge and who ambushed us at the gateway back to our land.  Ace's
laser shot paralyzed the towering preacher in the middle of
his terrible invectives as he dangled me four feet in the air.  We
were then able to return to the Wasteland via the talents of our
newfound ally, the ingenious Memory Resident Program, MeRP.</h5>

booming in a public square about the immorality of the city, and why
everyone would benefit at the Citadel (yeah, right).  Jax tried to move
closer to inspect the mysterious robed man, and swears it was their
poster child, but the guy blurred, and then vanished before he could get
closer.  Ace reckons it could have been a hologram, Chris thinks it was
sleight of hand, but Jax, after investigating the area afterwards came
to the astonishing conclusion that the Citadellians had teleport
technology! 

<p><h3><center> On the road again, the desert of New Nevada </center></h3><p>

It didn't take long for Jax to decide to make the Citadel our <i>numero uno</i>
concern.  After scouring the Triad (Quartz, Needles,
Vegas) for all the ammo and missiles we could afford or obtain
otherwise (legally of course!), we've taken to the deep desert. 
Our mission is to
sniff out The Citadel in the mountains beyond Hobo Village, where our
intelligence leads.  We're to scope their strength and numbers and bring
back some answers.  Jax is leading, and Taran's along as our tracker
(the Rangers' best), 
and Chris, Ace, Ellis, Paco 'n' I complete the unit.  
We're packing a full spread of manglers and ammo.
As for myself, Suzie and Emmie are keeping me company,
with Spade always in the wings.  Peydros wasn't assigned, as he 
is still at Highpool sheriffing (although people still call him the 
Mayor!).  I think he's part of Ranger intelligence, but
he strictly denies it, which deepens my belief.  He's the one told HQ 
about what the hobos said, hearing strange noises in the mountains
and all, I bet.  The Mayor must have zillions of contacts.
<p>
Dinner was nice and spicy.  Flame-broiled mutie-monsters, or mutated
Gila monsters, as they really should be called.  
Ellis called 'em ``gross,'' and stated she might become a vegetarian 
before long, cringing at the way we roasted 'em alive.  
You gotta roast 'em good or else the poison'll kill you.  But it makes for 
a great flavor!  She was accusing us of
animal cruelty when Ace chimed in, with his usual flippancy, ``Hey, 
don't get me wrong, babe---I love animals....  They're delicious.''
Paco's ensuing guffawing nearly splattered all of us with a mouthful.
<p>
Thunder in the distance and not a hint of clouds in the sunset.
Nevada is truly a strange land.  My watch is about to end.
Ever since Jax and T took us into the
desert less than a week ago, we've been travelling during night to 
conserve energy and water.
They scout the area during dusk and dawn, so that leaves the rest of us
to keep watch over ourselves sleeping like frakkin lizards under a
camo-tent during the sizzling hot, dry day.
So far nothing but a few dust-devils.
T doesn't even know what to sniff for.  Those guys
better get back soon before that thunder gets closer.  We need to move
to higher ground to avoid flash flooding of these arroyos.

<p><h3><center> That night </center></h3><p>

Frak. Jax and Taran haven't reported in, Ace is at the camp perimeter
shouting false alarms every time the desert spooks him,
Christina's nearly useless with anxiety and indecision,
Ellis and Metal are arguing and Metal's kicking a rock, and I've got 
sand fleas.
That thunder I heard wasn't thunder this afternoon, but now I think it
was an explosion or two.  Whoever it was, Jax and T gave 'em hell.
Not even a peep on the frakkin secure channel.  HQ hasn't heard either,
and are advising that we stay put and on guard, and to retreat back towards
Highpool if they don't come back by midnight.
Metal's shouting that they're dead since they didn't call in, and that
we should return to base to regroup while we're still undiscovered,
and Ellis doesn't want to hear Metal's loud yappings about death.
Truth is, we can't make it without a scout if we push on, yet we can't
know for sure that J & T are*

<h5>*In the diary, there is a
heavily indented swath of ink originating here and traveling up
the page in a smooth 10cm arc. ---ed.</h5>

[. . .]

<p><h3><center> Canyon </center></h3><p>

OK, I have a lot to write tonight.  Metal was absolutely right, but at
least he's not gloating.  We
should've abandoned our camp right then, like Jax had said we should if
he hadn't called in,
but we were all too stubborn for that, and we got ambushed after dark 
by the Citadel.  It couldn't have been anybody else.
The frakkers set up a death trap about the camp with exact
precision.  These guys ain't amateurs.  It was only pure luck that we
were able to bust out.  And we even managed to wing one of 'em and hold
her for questioning.  Yes, <i>her</i>.  Christina's all infuriated that I
didn't just plug her full of holes when I had the chance, because now
she's unconscious and impeding our retreat to HQ.  
Chris's off scouring the battle sight
for clues and burning off her post-battle adrenaline.
<p>
Our captive has lost alot of blood---I shot her in the leg, a 
little bit too close to an artery.  I thought my laser sight was 
shining on a hefty pectoral
muscle, and almost fired off a burst, but I quavered when I saw the 
long hair, flipped Emmie to
single shot mode and squeezed off a round into her leg, incapacitating,
but not killing her.
Ellis stabilized the downed woman's wounds as soon as we realized she was 
still alive, (in fact she was the only one the Citscum ``loss-cutters'' 
missed) and 
Metal and I hefted her down to this cave in a nearby canyon after the 
smoke had cleared.
<p>
So here we are, in another dilemma.  Chris and Ace are all for scatting
across the killer desert to Highpool, to use the radio there to warn HQ of
the reality of the Citadel, of course leaving ``Jane Doe'' behind to
die.
Metal would like that too, but he won't leave without me, and I'm not
going to be
responsible for her death, if I was responsible for sparing her life.
Besides, I think that if she's the talking type, we could get more
answers from her.  Ellisande is our only medic, and so she's staying as
well, despite her recent frostiness toward Metal, undiminished by the
high probability that he saved her life by taking out the Citscum 
that stormed her position when her AK jammed during the fight. 
I think we could take the roundabout way to Highpool via the
canyon, where we can go slower, cover our tracks, always be near water,
and rest frequently should Jane begin to walk.  HQ should be able to 
hold its own for a week, and already knows something's fishy after
not hearing from us.
<p>
The ambush was an unusual tactic.  The initial EM flash grenade wiped
out all our circuit-dependent equipment (i.e. radio, gieger counter, but
strangely enough, not my laser scope) and caught us all off guard, except
perhaps Ace, but he was crying wolf long before he may have discovered
what was up, so we ignored him.  They had set up, unknown to us, nine
wide vertical-beam laser batteries around us in a perfect circle, and
started firing them at us in the middle.  The guns fired in a seemingly
random order, one at a time.  Within a few seconds, we were all pinned 
to the ground, trying to creep out of the center of the circle, and we
realized that the guns weren't the only problem---black-clad assassins 
were coming for us on foot, inside the circle of doom---they knew the 
firing pattern evidently!  
I don't know how many of them there were, but we were
sitting (and two of us glowing) ducks, and were exchanging fire with 
them, and 
trying at the same time to dodge and destroy the big guns that kept 
firing their green walls of radiation.
We were better shots than they were, and our handheld firepower was
fairly matched, thank goodness, or our bones would have been bleaching 
under the sun today.
<p>
Well, Christina was trying to hit the guns with our twelve 
manglers, but was having no luck sighting any of them before they
flickered coherent rays of death, and the rest of
us were picking off the ambushers but they still kept coming, when I
had a flash of recollection.  The ring of guns reminded me of pigeon pie
for some strange reason.  I must have shouted my disbelief of what my
brain was putting me through in the midst of the battle, or something,
because Chris' head shot my way strangely and froze, backlit by cactus
fire for a few seconds, as two lasers zapped on by between us.  
Then she whirled 180&#176; and popped a
mangler straight into the night, missing a startled Citadellian, but
miraculously hitting one of the hidden lasers with a great crackling 
burst of plasma energy.
She loaded another, whirled around, dropped and rolled decisively (what
she would later call the Yllandian manuever) into 
the smoking path of what seconds before was a wall of death, and 
slammed another laser with her first shot!  And again and again.  
She was incredible!
<p>
All this time, Ace had managed to get knocked out somewhere, and 
Ellis, Paco 'n' I were delivering Citadellian death warrants.  Afterward, 
when I asked Chris what had happened, she
said that when she heard me shout the word ``pie,'' she thought of
Jax's favorite number of the same name (why anybody would name a number
after a dessert is beyond me), which she'd memorized in
college---evidently
it's so big that it has a lot of digits, and it only took Chris a
few seconds to figure that the guns were firing in an order 
corresponding to the digits.  I wondered why there were only nine guns
when there are ten digits, and Chris took a big breath and 
said flatly ``They must not have been expecting to fire them too long: 
0 doesn't appear until decimal digit 32, and perhaps they wanted to 
take advantage of the decreased symmetry of a nonagon.''  
She's a real brainer, that woman.
<p>
Well, anyway, the tide had definitely turned with Christina's discovery,
and the Citadellians were becoming more desperate and disorganized.  
In one last surge,
with only one laser operating erratically (but still on sequence!) they
blitzed us from all sides.  We were surely outnumbered and would have
perished, but at that point Ace showed up and emptied an entire magazine
into their surprised flanks, yelling like the ``dickens'' all the while, 
and they dispersed confusedly, fleeing into the
safety of the black beyond the cactus fires.  All but a few that is.
During the surge, I'd winged Jane Doe, and she had dropped down writhing,
but two or three Citscum looped back and started shooting their own
wounded!  Nearly hulching with disbelief, I recovered, and reintroduced 
'em to Emmie and Suzie, on the slim chance they hadn't met 'em before.

<p><h3><center> Canyon, Day 1 </center></h3><p>
It's the morning of the day after.
Things are tense here.  Nobody wants to make the decision to stay or go.
Things were sure a whole lot easier when Jax was runnin' the show.
I see no alternative to splitting up our group: HQ must be notified of
the tactical intelligence we gathered ASAP, but yet our still-KO'd 
Citadellian is potentially
too valuable to give up.  Christina's in a funk, since she's worried about
Metal an' Ellis an' I not having had enough deep desert experience, but it 
really comes down to nothing else.  It's suicide to travel the dunes 
to Highpool alone, so she must take
someone, but it can't be Ellis on account of Jane needing her medical 
skills, and Metal and I work best together.  So Ace is the only one.
<p> 
Meanwhile, Jane isn't giving us any answers (of course she can't 'cuz
she's still out cold!).  Only more questions. 
Chris wasn't surprised at the items Jane carried on her, saying most of
the other bodies carried the same thing, with the exception of an 
interesting small grey metallic box which she lifted off what may 
have been the leader's body.  Neither Ace nor I could ID it, so
Chris's saving it for analysis if we ever get back to base.
Anyway, the only items Jane carried were a cheap kevlar flak vest, a 
restricted range comm-link headset (it's useless now), her gun (she 
hadn't even fired off a shot from this poorly maintained 
AK-97, which I already cannibalized to repair Ellis' gun), 
and the strangest thing of all---a little foil package sewed into
a pant leg (we'd have never found it had I not shot
right through it).  Ellis inspected the pill inside and scrunched up her 
face.  The wrapper said ``pain killer,'' but Ellis' face said
differently: ``It's cyanide, boys.''

<p><h3><center> That night </center></h3><p>

Well, it's official.  Chris and Ace left at dusk, after hours of
argument.  We saw them off gravely and all had our good-byes.
I thanked Chris for her
leadership and inspiration, to which she humpfed, ``I'm no Jax.''
But I reminded her that we made it through the death trap, a fact for 
which I would be eternally beholden to her.  
Paco told Ace to watch Chris's rear, but Ace didn't catch the joke and
said, ``So long's my luck hangs in there, dude.''
I told him it would, and offered in optimism
that he should aim more carefully when he
rescues us next time---``If you've only got one shot, you sure don't
wanna frakkin blow it!'' (Ellis nearly had a hole in her head to show for
Ace's mad barrage at the end of the battle!)
Chris and Ellis hugged a while, taking strength from their mutual
losses, although I think Ellis has been over Taran for some time now.
Chris looked at me and told us she'd see us back at HQ, and they were gone.
<p>
If all goes well, and their water lasts, they'll reach Highpool in 48
hours, travelling nights, doubletime.  Jane is still unconscious. 
Ellis's out getting dinner---probably some frakkin prickly pears and other
cacti (oh, rapture), and Metal is collecting tumbleweeds for the fire.  
We've decided
to rest one more night in this great little cave before we start moving
at a slower pace along the canyon to Highpool, dragging Jane on a kind
of rack with a wheel.  It would be nice if Jane
would wake up and walk on her own two feet.  Or hobble.  Frak, she may
even refuse to cooperate.  I wouldn't feel right pumping her for info
then just dumping her, though that's what Metal wants to do.  
Sheesh what would Jax do in this case?
<p>
I drew watch duty.  Sure is lonely.  
The cool wind carries a sweet pi&ntilde;on scent which mingles with the
leathery odor of my pack.  
The codes I used to memorize nightly are useless
now that the radio's smoked, but I still keep the tradition and write my 
diary between the codewords.  My guns are as clean as ever, but suddenly
I'm all uneasy about this whole deal.  My kidneys just pumped a shot of
adrenaline in my veins, but for what reason?  Frak, ``Why?'' is the
question of the year, and no answers are convincing.
I'm getting skittish, like Ace, who almost frakkin crac[. . .]

<p><h3><center> Day 2, Dawn </center></h3><p>
What a time we're in for.  Last night, Myra, Acolyte-fifth tier, of the
Citadel (formerly Jane Doe) announced her consciousness by blasting me
with sarcasm, ``So you keep a journal as well, my crazy canine captor?
<i>This</i> I would not have anticipated from the scruffy infidel who 
nearly maimed me.  Fascinating.''  I was too stupid to reply.  
<p>
She must have been playin' 'possum 
for quite some time, for she knew all our names and
our plans.  In fact, she had picked up quite easily, that we weren't going 
to pump her for info then shoot her---I guess I'd been a bit too vocal
to Metal about my gumptions---so now, we're stuck with a pseudo-prisoner 
who I think <i>enjoys</i> our company, and over whom we hold absolutely no
leverage.  I thought we'd have a time getting her to talk.  Man was I wrong.  
Now we don't know what to do with her, but she seems in no hurry to
``escape.''
<p>
Nobody slept at all last night, and Myra went on and on about
Citadellian philosophy and how
our feeble efforts to stop the Citadel were in vain, and that they knew
all about us Rangers, and HQ, and that HQ was probably trashed by now.   
Metal jumped at that last one, and nearly busted her wide open, if it
hadn't been for me restraining him, but she just seemed to be taunting him,
so I don't know if that was reliable or not.  Still, the news of their
awareness of us is devastating, and we decided last night to doubletime 
it back to Highpool after resting after breakfast today.  
We'll take the canyon  
(we don't trust the desert without a guide) and hopefully be able to 
reach HQ with the radio at Highpool in a few days.  We're ``forcing''
Myra to limp along between Paco 'n' I, although she seems like she would
have followed us anyway, since she finds us so frakkin interesting. 

<p><h3><center> Dusk </center></h3><p>
Well, all's quiet again.  We're resting in the canyon floor after dinner
before travelling on again
tonight.  Doubletiming it during the day 
was a big mistake.  We tired too easily, got nearly dehydrated and
Myra's wound opened up again.
She's snoring next to the dinner fire, after having been rebandaged by
Ellis, and Maddog's got
his AK in his sack with him, just in case Myra tries anything.  Metal thinks
he sleeps light, but the guy can sleep through an earthquake---heck he
didn't know his tool shed had blown sky high until he woke the next morning.  
I just clicked his gun to ``safety,'' so's he won't ventilate 
Myra, (or Ellis an' I!) in his sleep. 
<p>
Ellis says that Myra's leg is healing nicely.  It was not as bad a wound
as we'd thought.  Just really messy.  I don't know what to think of Myra.  
She's a strange one, and Metal doesn't trust her a smidge.  Ellis is 
right nice to her, and they were just talking away today about <i>men</i>, of
all things.  Paco broke 'em up when he realized they were laughing at
him.  Ellis is taking her medic/patient relationship a bit too far, I
think, but maybe she's just trying to get Myra to give up more info
about the Citadel.  I gave up
trying to talk strategy to Ellis a long time ago, but perhaps there's
more brains below her blond mop than I'd previously reckoned.  I mean
don't get me wrong (who's going to read this frakkin' scrawl 
anyway?)---Ellis is probably the most educated Ranger I know, next to
Jax, but he's probably dead anyway---but she doesn't seem to use it, or
enjoys people underestimating her, or she plain just doesn't let on to
people who wouldn't appreciate her.  Now that's an interesting think.
Well, I have been known to frakkin totally misjudge a person.
<p>
At any
rate, Myra's given Ellis more attention than anyone has for quite some
time ('cept Paco, but she doesn't go for his kind), and I can understand 
how Ellis hung around her all day.  Metal's
all in a Paco-funk again because he can't understand Myra's at-ease kind of
attitude.  I don't think he likes not being able to frighten Myra, and
he still's hurt that Ellis won't talk to him.  Them two ganging up on
Paco like that isn't fair, but it sure is funny to see him squirm. 
Actually I think Paco likes them talking about him.
Paco's a simple guy, I can read him like a book.
<p> 
Myra watches me alot when she's not talking with Ellis or making fun 
of Paco.  My guess is she silently resents me 
frakkin up her leg, although she has never confronted me with it,
or even complained about the limp.  But, I think she actually 
complimented my roasted rad-rat that
we had for dinner when she said to me, ``Well spin my top quark if this 
dinner is not wickedly piquant!  You continue to surprise me 
doggie-breath.''  I had to get Ellis to repeat that for me
just now (she's putting out the fire) since there's no way I could
remember the words, or even decipher them.  Ellis said it was a
reference to particle physics.  I don't know.  I have to see the words in a
book before I can really begin to understand them.  As for my breath,
well, Myra obviously ain't been downwind of Paco yet. 
<p>
Coyote's announcing its domain at the canyon rim, and probably eyeing 
our dinner scraps with envy.  Frak, feels like it's watching <i>me</i>.
Glowing in a darkened desert does make me feel a tad vulnerable.  
Myra turned over
deliberately when I turned to look for the coyote.  Musta been awake. 
Whoa, Metal's just clicked off his safety, silently cursing our Citadellian
``prisoner.''  That's right Paco, just roll off to sleep again.  OK,
I just re-safety'd his AK.  It's been doing fine lately, mostly because
I've been cleaning it for him.  If it's got more than three moving
parts, it's too much for Metal, or he says it's poorly designed.  We had
it rechambered back at HQ and it now pours out the same lead-incased
depleted U-238 ``rhino-bane'' that Emmie does.  
<p>
I wonder how good Myra
is with a gun.  I wonder alot of things about her.  She's an
``unknown variable,'' as Ace once said about her, when I asked his opinion
on what we should do with her.  With his usual luck, Ace hit the jackpot on
this gamble.  The only way to understand her is not to try at all.
I keep telling myself she's a now-sworn enemy of the Rangers, but I keep
finding myself thinking otherwise.  She has never threatened us, only
insulted us.  Her weapons are sarcasm and unpredictability.  If she has
a weakness, we haven't found it yet.  But why even try?  What could she
tell us?  Maybe winging her back at the camp was a mistake.  Why
couldn't I have winged a sergeant, or corporal, or whatever---frak,
anything but a sarcastic female fifth tier Acolyte with perfect English.
But no, I had no choice.  I couldn't kill her at that
point.  It was a promise that I couldn't break---a promise to myself 
to honor the memory of a woman that I'll never see again. 

<p><h3><center> Day 3, Dawn</center></h3><p>

After a night's hike, we aren't as physically exhausted because we
didn't rush, but I still feel drained.  We had a strange incident about
an hour ago with Myra that has caused her to go mute and unmoving on us, 
but I'll get to that later.  We're still a day or two outside 
of Highpool.  It was actually kind of uneventful except for a few 
close calls with a pack of wild dobermutants or something, 
and the Myra thing.  
We didn't actually have an encounter, but I could tell we 
were being tracked, and didn't like it, so I took us to a higher route.
We found a good dried up saguaro and punched the spines inside the
largest branch to make a
crutch for Myra.  She admired our ingenuity.  I didn't tell her that it
was an ancient trick used by the natives in these parts to make ``rain
sticks,'' for when you turned the hollow cactus branch 180&#176;, the
freed thorns cascaded down through the swiss-cheese inside of the cactus 
and made a tinkling rushing sound that was supposed to attract rain. 
<p>
Ellis was watching Myra's condition at the beginning by travelling beside
her, but later on when she realized she was going to be fine on her own,
she let Myra crutch along beside me in the rear, and helped Metal find 
our way on the canyon walls.
I wasn't sure why Myra started telling me about what she did at the
Citadel, but I figured she was homesick, and had to keep the memories
fresh.  I think she may have been trying to avoid the thought that we'd
never let her go back.  
Evidently, she was a glass-maker in the complex,
and her group made fine crystal goblets, so fine that
some high-ranking brother commissioned a whole bunch from them.  
<p>
Her idol was the master glass-blower, whose
trademark was ``characteristic resonance.''  This guy could create a
crystal glass so carefully that if you rubbed the lip of it with a
slightly wet finger, it would hum for the fraction of a second with the
clearest tone you'd ever heard, but then the goblet would shatter,
because the guy had crafted it so that the tone would do such a thing.
I said it sounded loco, but evidently the brethren were crazy about
them.  Trouble is, you could never know if you had the real thing unless
you destroyed it by checking for the tone!
<p>
I felt odd that Myra had opened up like that, without warning.  But I
rather appreciated her candor.  Here was a really interesting, intricate
person whom I could really learn to like.  I shuddered at the thought,
as my Ranger honor hovered back into my brain, but then I thought of
Lupita, and I missed her terribly.
After a prolonged period of silence, when the only noises were the wild
cries of mutant wolves and other beasties, and the calming intermittent 
swishes of Myra's rainstick-crutch, I told her that I didn't understand 
her.  Fact was, I
didn't understand myself, my feelings.  I thought, frak,
this is loco, but couldn't help it, she'd broken me with her mystery.  
<p>
She responded in turn, 
``You are equally ever the enigma, Mr. Fargo, but a poor shot.  I should have
never survived that battle, and now our fates are inexplicably 
intertwined, perhaps to your disadvantage.''
I don't know how she knew my last name, maybe Ellis told her.  But the
way she said it made my neck muscles spasm.
I said that I didn't regret not killing her, and that I further didn't
regret killing the loss-cutter.  That did it.
<p>
She slowed her crutching,
and looked at me for the first time since we'd been talking.  I saw the
white slits of her eyes in the light of the waxing moon.  Those eyes
glowed with an unworldly light, and pleaded a clarification.  
``Some of your comrades doubled back after the
fight to finish off the wounded.  I killed them before they got to
you.''  Myra stopped, and wavered a bit on her crutch.  She stuttered  
something incomprehensible.  Sounded like <i>``Madre de Dios,''</i>
but I didn't think she knew the language.   
<p>
Then she stuttered again, and she jerked her head back at me, causing me
to shudder as her black hair rushed into her eyes.  She spoke
haltingly, softly, but got increasingly louder and more coherent, as she
parted her hair to reveal a different, pained face,
``The p---the pill, what about that little pill that you shot through.
I know you found it, because it wasn't there when I looked.  Did you
look at it?  Did you identify it?  <i>Tell me!</i>''  And then, ``Mad Dog,
p---please!''
At this, Metal and Ellis turned around in unison and walked back to us.  
Myra leaned to and fro on her rainstick.  Wet streaks sparkled down her 
face.  A lonely howl richocheted throughout the canyon, followed by a
host of other eerie howls.
I remember thinking strangely about ``characteristic resonance.''
I think at that moment I'd shattered something more than a goblet. 
<p>
Before I could stop Ellis, she blurted out ``Cyanide.  That so-called
pain-killer was cyanide, Myra, and I'd been meaning to tell you, but
forgot.  <i>Some friends</i> you had in... the... Citadel....  
Oh, I'm so sorry, Myra.''  
<p>
Myra had expected the answer I think.  Somewhere in the
periphery of her mind, she knew the truth about her Citadel life.  She
knew it was all fake.  It's like having the floor disappear from 
beneath you and you just keep falling and falling.  She's still a
zombie and curled up in a ball, having dropped right down where she 
was leaning on her crutch after Ellis' tactless spasm.  I wanted to
console Myra, since I brought her troubles all on, but frak, how could I
frakkin console her?  It was clear that things <i>weren't</i> going to 
be ``all right.''
Instead I'm just sitting next to her, rubbing her back with one hand,
writing with the other as the light grows over the lip of the canyon.  
Paco looked at me funny once, but I didn't care.  Myra's ceased being 
a Citscum.  She's human, frak it.
<p>
Ellis has been able to get her to eat now, and Metal is at least not making
things worse---he found this small recession that will provide some
cover from the heat today.  Metal even looks a bit sympathetic.  
I think we'll just stay here today and try to continue down the canyon
at dusk.

<p><h3><center> Dusk</center></h3><p>

OK, Myra's up on her feet, but still not talking.  She keeps looking at
me with that <i>look</i>.  It's indescribable.  It's like nothing I've ever
encountered.  
Makes me feel some new feelings, which I kind of resent, since I can't
make enough sense outta my old emotions as it is.  It's like I'm moving
through a familiar tub of molasses.  Like I've been there before, that is.
Myra holds onto her crutch like it's the last clip of .45 on the planet,
and her incomprehensible stare follows me everywhere. 
That's good enough for me.  She's ambulatory.  
We need to move out since I'm thinking the wandering
pack creatures have gotten bolder during the last night.  I wouldn't
want them to get the idea we're an easy eat.

<p><h3><center> Midnight</center></h3><p>

Frak, this is it.  Dragonlizards attacked.  Musta been
stalking us for while but never saw 'em.  
Surprised the frak outta Ellis and Paco who took first hit.  Took
whole clip to down one of 'em.  They managed to bite Ellis 'n' Metal. 
My legs so clawed up---I think necessary tendons cut.  I'm maimed.
We scared most of 'em off with noise of our guns, good thing since
their scales blunted our shots.
I am deeply saddened to write---both Metal, Ellis slipped into comas.  
Dragonlizard bites unpredictable, ranging from dizziness to 
death, Myra said, tending my legs afterwards.
There's nothing I can do.  There's no cure but to try to outlast the
poison.  I don't think they'll make it though.
I'm faint and stuck looking at what used to be my shins.
<p>
Myra untouched, as I shoved her into rock fissure 
when they dropped on Ellis from above.  Myra yelled ``No!'' the whole
time.
She finally limped out as I ran outta ammo, jabbed at 
last two with crutch.  One lost footing and fell down canyon. 
The other had a fl'echette sandwich.  It's last meal.
She helped me into shade, dragged others there too, 
loaded up my guns, water.  She's gone now.  <i>Madre de Dios</i>,
she's gone.  But I may die in peace.

<p><h3><center> [Last Entry]</center></h3><p>

Only company is fleet of vanadium vultures I keep
scaring away from Ellis, Paco with rocks.  
Fever dream few mins ago: We made it to HP,
but when radioed HQ, got looped recording: ``Moved to 
Citadel'' and maniacal laughter.
<p>
I'd told Myra she was only one left that could make HP. 
Before I'd asked, she said ``How can you trust me to return?''
I said, ``Sometimes you gotta forgo the shatter test and trust you've
got the genuine item.''
Then she blinked few times.  Her face softened, she looked away (toward
Citadel?), wiped her eyes.
She looked back, told me not to die on her, and got up to
go.  Asked her if she needed Emmie---I could survive with or without
it.  She continued limping off, but then turned abruptly, smiled strangely, 
said naturally in my accent,
``Guns are for shooting, M.D., but women, we do best without 'em.''<br>
<br><br><br><br>

<h2><center>Appendix</center></h3><p>

Ranger Archives has urged me to postscript this remarkable compilation 
of notes. 
It is a near-tangible sense of shared history, however that compells me.
Upon my party's return to the Wasteland, we trekked from the
Hole to HQ and found the message ``Moved to Citadel.  The Rangers.''  
In retrospect, one begins to appreciate Mr. Fargo's mutant prescience:
we now know the message to be a fabrication, and we highly suspect that soon 
after HQ's last sorties were sent out (my group was to reconnoiter the
Citadel, and another was to rescue Mr. Fargo et al.), a Citadellian raid 
crushed HQ and left behind the cruel joke.   
<p>
At any rate, my party located the post-purge Citadel, using pre-purge 
Ranger Intelligence's last findings, and set up HQ2 there.  
The fortress was abandoned, save for
little cones of dust here and there.  I have now determined the dust to
be chemically human in origin.  My best guess leads me to postulate that
the Citadellians abandoned during the purge were instantly
disintegrated <i>before</i> the purge ended.  Given the Citadel's
penchant for killing off its human baggage, as evidenced in the diary,
mine is not a difficult theory to stomach.  
In fact, we found Mr. Fargo's code book/diary on top of a
splattered dust cone (Myra?) inside a small sparsely decorated dorm
room in the Citadel.
<p>
This discovery, and the well-worn rainstick crutch recovered from the
same room, lead me to conclude that Myra indeed returned to the site 
of the dragonlizard ambush, and from there, made her way back to the 
Citadel, all in the time before the purge.  We have since scoured the 
canyon to find the remains of Mr. Fargo, Metal Maniac, and Ellisande 
Llendwynn, but have come up empty-handed.  As
mentioned in a footnote, any Rangers in the Wasteland
after the purge ceased to exist when the ASCII Ranger file was
rewritten to the Wasteland Scenario Disk as a consequence of my Ranger 
party returning to New Nevada, so it is doubtful that we will 
ever uncover what truly happened to these heroes of our past.
Equally as doubtful are any hopes to elucidate the identity of the
enigmatic Citadellian Myra.
<p>
Ace Maloney, the only surviving Ranger to
have served with Mr. Fargo, remembers fondly his comrade's unassuming
leadership and brilliance in combat.
I never had the priviledge of meeting Mr. Fargo, but every time I
ambulate past his display in the Ranger Hall of Fame, I stop and reflect
upon his words, written in a determined hand, and his presence is somehow 
familiar and palpable.  Perhaps he never realized how much an effect his
story could have on future generations of Rangers, but his history is
now a part of ours, and through his example we derive strength.
