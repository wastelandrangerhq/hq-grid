Somewhere, a bell rang.  It was strident, even muted as it was by the twisting
and turning of the concrete corridors.  Corporal Bigsby hurried toward the
elevator, clutching his package tightly.  As he rounded a corner, he collided
with some form of living wall.  The olive drab mass solidified into a cursing
behemoth of a Recruitment Officer, Lieutenant Graper.
<p>“Sweet Jesus, Bigsby!  You’re under my wheels again!”
<p>Bigsby mouthed an incoherent apology that was unheard in the storm of
imprecation that continued down the corridor past him.  He swallowed, and
walked to the elevator.  The button was already lit, but in his agitation,
Bigsby pressed it several times rapidly.  It earned him a strange glance
from another corporal who was posting bulletins on a tall board in the center
of the room.
<p>The door opened and Bigsby stepped inside.  They shut again and the
lights in the elevator dimmed for a moment as it lurched downward with
surprisingly little noise.  Only a moment and it stopped, the door sliding
open with a slight whoosh.  It was quiet here on the lower level of the
Ranger Center, the Sanctuary.
<p>It was an old tradition to place the people in charge below ground,
and the tradition was upheld here as well.  The lower level, when the Center
was a federal prison, had held maintenance, laundry, and storage facilities
as well as solitary confinement.  It was still dark and dreary despite the
lights and neutral-painted walls.  
<p>Bigsby carried his package through the vestibule, noticing that
there was a similar bulletin board down here.  It didn’t bear the uniform
size and typing the enlisted men and lower-level officers were required to
use.  These memos were handwritten in the arcane scrawl of majors, colonels,
and generals.  The slips of paper used were of every size, color, and state
of soilage.  The lower level of the Ranger Center was almost a different world.
<p>He continued into the long hallway that bisected the level.  It was
lit by bare, hanging bulbs.  He ignored his first set of two doors, which
were the offices of Senior General Vargas and Senior General Squid.  He
stopped at the next set of doors.  The left-hand door was Major General
Romulus’ office, and the right-hand door, which bore the sign “Laundry” was
his destination.  He knocked on the door timidly, almost losing the
package.  A voice penetrated the metal door somewhat muffled, barking what
seemed to be an invitation to come in.
<p>Twisting the handle, Corporal Bigsby felt a trace of fear.  He had
never spoken to a general personally, and never visited the Sanctuary.  He
opened the door.
<p>The room was enormous, and had definitely once been a laundry.  It
had a high ceiling, and bore evidence of a great number of machines that had
once been there.  It had been reconverted, and the walls were covered in
tasteful wood panels.  
<p>Its contents not withstanding, the room showed evidence of some order,
though a kind of order produced by a warped mind.  A long table in the center
of the room was covered with papers in disarray, and his eye was drawn to one
of the walls.  It bore an enormous map of the United States, though it had
been altered and annotated to be almost unrecognizable.  There were thousands
of notes written on the map, or on slips of paper that had been posted to
it.  For a moment, Bigsby had forgotten where he was, and as he gaped at the
map, he heard a throat clear.  
<p>Bigsby’s head snapped in the direction of the noise, and saw an
ancient rolltop desk in the corner of the room.  Major General MacManus was
seated there; a giant man in some sort of bastardized uniform.  He wore the
khaki dress shirt and jacket, but had on a kilt over his extremely hairy legs
that ended in plaid socks and combat boots.  His face, coarse-featured and
stubbly with sandy hair, was turning bright red.  
<p>The bottom dropped out of Bigsby’s stomach when he realized that he
had forgotten to salute the general.  He dropped the package from nerveless
arms and watched it hit the floor with a look of surprise.  He attempted to
salute, but his arm flailed uselessly at his head.  The general now looked
merely bewildered, and Bigsby’s line of sight fell to the level of the
general’s boots as he fell forward in a dead faint.
<p>He woke from the ammonia fumes of a smelling salt, with a wide, rough
hand slapping his face back and forth.  It was General MacManus.  Bigsby
saluted, and the general burst into laughter.
<p>“I’ve seen men go insane from a firefight, Corporal, but I’ve never
seen a man faint at a map.”
<p>“I’m sorry, sir, I-“
<p>“Don’t worry about it, Corporal.”  He looked at Bigsby’s prone
position and sneered.  “At ease.”
<p>Bigsby stood up hurriedly and saluted again, doing his best to look
dignified.
<p>“Sir?”
<p>“Corporal Bigsby… you’re the science whiz I heard about, eh? You
brought me this package, but who gave it to you?”
<p>“Sergeant Jennings, sir.  Sergeant Hattori brought it back with him
from his recon.”
<p>“Hattori, eh?  He’s back?”
<p>“He was found dead between here and Highpool.  A patrol found him
just before a party of scavs got there, sir.”
<p>“Hmm… well, this must have been worth something, then.  Any other word
from his recon group?”
<p>“No sir, not since their last radio transmission.”
<p>“When was that?”
<p>“A week ago, sir.  They radioed in from the coast, just east of Toluca
Lake.”
<p>“They made it, then.”  The general turned to his map and traced a
finger to the jagged line that demarcated the new coast of California. “Toluca
Lake, now Toluca Island.  Home of the Toluca Lake Mystery Hole.”
<p>“Mystery hole, sir?”
<p>“Nothing.  That’s what the recon was there for.  To explore the island
and its hole.”
<p>“Yes sir.”
<p>MacManus hefted the package and considered it for a moment.  “I take
it he wrote my name on the wrapping?”
<p>“We think so, sir.”
<p>“Thank you, Corporal.  That will be all.”
<p>Bigsby saluted and about-faced as the general began unwrapping the
package.  The young corporal resisted his curiosity until he got to the door,
and could not resist a sneak peak as he was shutting the door.  General
MacManus opened the box, and an astounded look passed on his face.  He seemed
to be in awe.  Rapt in his examination, the general spoke out loud.
<p>“Dear Lord, we need more of this…”  He noticed that Bigsby was still
there and shot a glare at him.  “Corporal Bigsby!  I said that would be all!”
<p>“Y-yes sir!”  He was about to leave when suddenly the general had
grabbed him by the shoulder and spun him around.
<p>“Wait a minute, Corporal.  Run a message to the Senior Generals.  Tell
them I’m going to be sending a four-man party of my Heavy Infantry to find
out what happened there.  I’ll have it written up in a bit.  And ASAP,
Corporal.”  He saluted, and Bigsby returned it.  “And Corporal?  Outfitting
shouldn’t take but an hour and a half.  Report to me at that time.  You’ll
be heading out at 2100 hours.”
<p>Corporal Bigsby felt the bottom drop out of his stomach again as he
realized what the general was saying.  MacManus looked surprised again as
Bigsby fell to the ground in a dead faint for the second time that day.
