<FONT FACE="Book Antiqua"><P>Prenotes</FONT> from the Author</P>
<P>Just a couple things you may want to know before reading this:</P>
<P>According to <I>Fountain of Dreams </I>and <I>Wasteland:</P>
</I><P>Florida, in 1996, was converted into a radiated island in the middle of the Gulf of Mexico by numerous nuclear and neutron bomb attacks.  Mutants soon popped up, products of the intense, gene-warping radiation.  Mickey's Wall was built by post-war Floridians as a protective physical barrier to defend themselves from 'the outside.'  It surrounds the island completely, allowing no passage.  Also surfacing was the legendary Fountain of Youth, discovered shortly after the bombs, which had the power to restore natural health to those afflicted by mutation.  At the time of the story <I>Dream Tales</I>, this fountain of dreams had not been located.</P>
<P>Southern Nevada was also struck by numerous nuclear and neutron blasts.  The Wasteland is the lightly populated region of middle Nevada that has recovered somewhat from the blasts.  Although Florida's current time is Summer of 1997, the Wasteland, suffering the same radioactive fate at the same time, is set in the year 2018, 21 years later.  This has caused some confusion with readers, seeing that the two worlds are separated in time.  Those readers have been kidnapped and beaten for their stupidity... may you not have the same fate.</P>
<P>Back in Florida, the famed Clown College of Miami fell under the influence of some evilly mutated clowns and has since been populated by the evil, murderous cult known as Killer Clowns.  They manufacture their own weaponry, elect leaders, and seal themselves into the fortress-like campus of the priorly famous college, defending themselves from intruders with howitzer cannons mounted on protected turrets at four corners of the square compound.</P>
<P>In the Wasteland, even before the bombs, a man by name John Irwin Finster had a dream of humanity breathing with a metallic stench.  He created the program originally known as Project Darwin, a computer entity capable of extreme growth and evolution.  Finster provided the computer with the masterplan infinite expansion, both intellectual and militaristic, and set it running on its feet, housed inside a massive structure known as Base Cochise.  The Base has turned into less a scientific research project and more into a mechanical production facility.  The spawn of Finster’s project, intelligent, combative cyborgs, have been constantly frustrated by human opposition.  Finster was soon hunted down and killed by the U.S. Army Corp, soon turned Desert Rangers.  These gallant rangers are the heroes of the Wasteland, operating out of a fortress known as The Citadel, former home of extremist Brothers of the Citadel.  These desert rangers, separated from United States military jurisdiction or higher authority, operate independently in coexistence with the peoples of the desert to serve as law and order and protection.</P>
<P>Some of the scientific terms in this book may appear too complex for mere lay-person's terms, but, they have been well combed over and thoroughly simplified and/or explained.  Failure to understand these simple scientific explanations will result in immediate kidnapping and shooting.  We hope you enjoy reading this novel, and may you do so with the greatest of comfort in your own home and finest reading pleasure, as you delve into this amazing story of psychological intrigue and physical confrontation called</P>

<FONT FACE="Haettenschweiler"><P>Dream Tales is a story composed of the adventures of two parties.  One group contains strangers in a strange land, trying to explain to themselves the truths of this new world.  The second party is that of a stranger in his own land, trying to explain to himself the truths of a world far from new to him.</P>

<h2><I><P>Chapter One</P></h2>
<P>Summer 1997, Florida Island</P>
</I><P></P>
<P>The spotlight swept by one more time.  </P>
<P>He swatted a mosquito the size of a thumbnail off his arm, and repositioned his stance low in the muddy grassland.  Depeche Quadri looked over the marshy grassland between his party's position and the Clown College.  One tower, at the north-east corner of the walls, packed twin Killer Clown Howitzer Cannons, and held two clowns, their red, yellow, and green faces scanning the same land through Clown Binoculars.  A clown at the tower nearest the front gate, cackled a high and screeching laugh, echoing through the entire valley island of Florida. </P>
<P>"Friggin' clowns." Afghan Albert mumbled to himself.  </P>
<P>"Shut your yap, you." Depeche quietly admonished.  Depeche squatted low in the grass, sweat in his dark hair messily parted down the middle, bangs hanging far down to his eyelashes.  Doc DeMedici would have to give him a haircut sooner or later.  Afghan piped down a bit.  Depeche turned back to face the Clown College.</P>
<P>"I hate clowns." Afghan muttered again, cleaning his lenses.  They were the only lenses of his prescription on the island, DeMedici had managed to find one in his old medical reserves.  The frames suited him well, small, round, and tight-fitting.  Depeche eyed him harshly for his speech, a break in the absolute silence needed to penetrate the compound.  The spotlight once again passed by them, and Depeche waved two fingers, and sprinted across the moonlit field.  His twin AK-47 assault rifles, over his shoulders, clicked together as he raced across the muddy ground, his boots squishing softly.  They had approximately 30 seconds until the next spotlight swept over.</P>
<P>Depeche Quadri was the party’s leader.  Tall, muscular, intelligent, and skilled in the fine art of freelance combat, Depeche was a natural-born fighter.  A survivalist by trade, a journeyman by choice, and a leader by default, he held the unconditional respect of party.  Years of Floridian heat, brawls, and vegetation had left his skin tough and hardened.  Depeche’s brusque manner did not afford him many close relationships other than the friends he fought alongside.  His charismatic appearance left something to be desired, but a quick wit and subtle genius made up for what he lacked in soft touch.  Nevertheless, Depeche was widely known and respected in Miami as a just humanist and a relentless pursuer of a good cause.  This also afforded him and his party their share of enemies in high places.</P>
<P>Fixer Jowe, the party's medic, bladesman, and soft-spoken warrior, erupted from the marsh in a speed undaunted by the watery ground or the stuffy air, twin machetes rattling in their 'X' on his back.  Fixer's incredible dexterity and unmatched strength made him a valuable member of the party's attack, and his machetes alone had were often a deterrent for violence.  Soft spoken but not slow witted, Fixer had been in the company of Depeche since childhood.  </P>
<P>Next was Wilfred, the pudgy, heavily-accented member of the team who had learned quickly his place in the team was less of a combat advantage and more of a moral obligation.  A member of the Obeahan Order, a cultish religion in Miami, Wilfred had joined the team as a debt to Depeche, who had single-handedly saved his life.  The Obeahans are a quirky group who keep their practices secret to outsiders, which leads many to believe their unity is based on social identity more than faith.  Their self-proclaimed leader is Wilfred's father, Big Daddy, a highly respected and intellectual man of enormous proportions who is a father figure to the entire Obeahan community.  Wilfred had attributed the series of events leading to his capture and liberation to fate, bringing him in contact with Depeche, Fixer, and Afghan, and thus felt it necessary to follow them and aid them as fate had decided.  His weapon of choice was his prize of many tight situations with the ground, his Clown Mega Uzi, (with grenade attachment.)  The gun was bored to take two different kinds of ammunition, and held a double clip magazine for extra firing time.  The mechanisms were very complicated, and even Depeche, weapon-smith and gunsmith, had trouble cleaning and unjamming it.  </P>
<P>Wilfred often reminded the group of his pseudo-religious cultic faith, and the belief in the coming of the mighty Conqueroo, a great warrior that would set wrongs to rights and evils to goods.  Until that day, Wilfred often claimed, the Conqueroo worked in more subtle ways.  Many times he would interprete every day occurrences as more cosmic signs or predictions.  Often times, the group just smiled and nodded at Wilfred's far-fetched convictions.</P>
<P>Last in the marching order to spring from hiding was the group's demolitions expert,  Afghan Albert.  Afghan was a slightly overweight man, and his internal-chambered napalm-spewing flame thrower, as well as his personally-gunsmithed M16A1 assault rifle helped make up for his lack of mobility.  Afghan chugged behind the short and hairy Wilfred, carrying his one-piece flame thrower and spare napalm container.  Wilfred and Afghan, like Depeche and Fixer, had also grown to be close friends through the two years of adventuring since Wilfred had joined the team.  </P>
<P></P>
<P>Depeche slowed his run and put his back against the high Clown College wall, the plastered brick warm from a long-set sun.  The two cackling Clowns thirty feet above.  Fixer Jowe immediately was by Depeche's side.  Wilfred was soon next to him, and after a while, Afghan showed up, breathing heavily.  Depeche looked up above, then to Afghan Albert, who had his hands on his knees and was panting.  Depeche whispered,</P>
<P>"Afghan! get out that plastique!"</P>
<P>The tension in the group was thick, and noticeable.  Certain tones in voices were amplified by stress, anxiety, and impatience.  The group’s cooperative efforts were well-run and organized, and emotional glitches seldom got in the way of operations.  It was an unspoken rule that personal life and combat are two separate worlds that will exist alone.  This was the way Depeche  liked to have it.</P>
<P>Afghan nodded while still heavily breathing and pulled out an old green JanSport bag, which had been sewn and re-sewn by Wilfred multiple times.  He unzipped the bag, and pulled out a small cube of white clay-looking substance.  Bahia special blend C-4, just enough ammonia to blast, but not too volatile.  Depeche pointed upward, then around the corner and to the main gate of the compound.  He mouthed:</P>
<P>"On three..."  He held up a fist as Afghan placed the charge and cell deep into the cube, gingerly releasing the pressure pin.  Depeche held up his first finger, and Afghan reared back.  With his second finger Afghan launched the cube upward, which was quickly followed by the third.  The group sprang forward and turned left around the corner.</P>
<P>The thick wad of grayish clay sailed over the guard rail and hit the ground of the turret with a soft –splat-.  The two clowns stopped cackling.  All was silent.  </P>
<P>The 10-second timer sounded.</P>
<P>With a deafening explosion the payload detonated inside the Killer Clowns' cradle-like tower, sending the double-barreled howitzer cannon down the side of the crumbling wall to the marsh below.  The ground shuddered as the shock wave rumbled the compound walls and hit the soggy earth.  It was forty feet from the corner of the compound to the center of the wall where the light gate was, and the group covered the ground quickly under the night sky.  Afghan quickly tucked away his bag of explosive goodies and followed the rest of the group through the open archway.   It had been a good blast, Afghan had sensed Depeche’s approval from a vicious &quot;<I>yesss…&quot;</I> from his mouth.</P>
<P>Depeche rolled into a crouch, unlatching the safeties on both of his fully loaded AK-47s.  Fixer held his UZI in one hand, another hand around the hilt of a sheathed machete.  Wilfred had his Mega Uzi at arm's length, and Afghan held his lit-up flame thrower.  The paunchy explosives expert pumped three ounces of air into the compressor chamber, then pumped into the pressurized hopper.  The air provided the explosive 'pop' that accompanied the release of the fiery napalm.  </P>
<P>What they faced across the gate was stunning.</P>
<P>No one.  </P>
<P>A dust ball rolled across the empty courtyard in the middle of the compound.</P>
<P></P>
<P>Same Time- New Nevada Desert</P>
<P></P>
<P>Oh, the life of an admin droid, Vax thought to himself.  His BRA, or Breathing and Respiration Apparatus, hissed quietly, cooling his generator.  His uplink to the main computer, the Monitoring Operational THermally Energized Reactor Computer, or M.O.T.H.E.R. Computer, fed the administrative robot information on the security checks.  The fiber-optic cable connected to the side of his optical sensors, so Vax actually "saw" the information.  No living object, besides a couple Rad Rats, wandered into the 30 meter-wide bio-scanning field that guarded the compound known as Base Cochise.</P>
<P>Vax sighed another mechanical sigh and looked onto the conveyor-like production room of Base Cochise through a high-resolution monitor in the control panel wall.  Equipped with a human-paradigm emotion program, Vax grew bored often.  It was a ‘gift’ only he and the restless master computer, MOTHER, had, and sometimes Vax wished he was just a stolid as an security drone.  Wonderful, another Octotron, one of the new Delta series, just hopped off the belt under its own power.  The octotron was a spheroid-bodied robot with eight spinning, razor-tipped arms and stationary ranged weaponry of varied selection, mostly charged-particle or electromagnetic based.  I'm thrilled.  He looked over to the only other non-combat droid in the entire base.</P>
<P>Even for a robot, his partner, Mov was annoying.  He sat there on his unipod conveyance wheel, a large ball bearing that moved him around, his visual cameras plugged into the N.N.N., the New Nevada Network, watching some kind of entertainment program, in which humans moved in a rhythmic manner to the beat of an unorganized array of music, with a small animated locomotive coal-powered engine superimposed on the bottom right-hand corner.  </P>
<P>Mov should have been making technical updates to the MOVE, or Molecular Open-Void Energizer machine, which was Cochise's method of quick transport.  Mov had helped design and construct it, and, thanks to an overly excessive cyber-ego, fails to run diagnostics or to check its operational status, claiming it to be errorless.  For all Vax knew, it could be broken and burnt out.</P>
<P>Mov was the first and last model of the OI class, the Octotron-Intelligence class, where MOTHER had tried to build an Octotron with a brain.  Plenty brain, not enough brawn.  Not nearly enough brawn.  Mov didn't even have 8 arms like an Octotron.  Much less, he had little room for weaponry with a complex gyroscopic balance system and a sophisticated long-range communications system.  Even Vax had two multi-jointed and omni-directional arms, with five multi-follicled fingers, capable of carrying and firing a sidearm.  Mov had a thick kevlar two foot- wide rollerball at his sturdy base for his mode of transit.  Mov had arms, but the five fingers at the end were pudgy.  Mov's physical strength was excellent, simply because of his Octotron ancestry.  Vax wasn't as strong, but he could handle a Cochisian Standard MX5000 Laser Rifle without effort.</P>
<P>The nature of MOTHER’s experiment to build a sophisticated and analytical octotron, that could be used as both a multi-purpose combat machine and a scientific and administrative unit similar to the function of Vax.  The product was not a mistake… nor was useless.  Mov was an exceptionally creative mind, his procreativity rating nearly matched Vax’s.  It was this ability to invent, and an augmented proclivity towards the pan-dimensional sciences led him to begin work on the MOVE.  </P>
<P>&#9;Mov's twin cyber-lips slowly dripped cyber-oil through his cyber-speech-orifice.  Vax reached into his databanks for contemporary human slang terms.  What a cyber-geek, Vax thought.</P>
<P></P>
<P>Florida Island</P>
<P></P>
<P>Depeche scanned the area.  Nothing.  Not one single multicolored Killer Clown in sight.   Not one laughing and disproportionate red-nosed child's amusement figure.  But they were here.  Hiding, giggling to each other.</P>
<P>He signaled his party to follow him, and stealthily dashed toward the closest building.  He wasn’t sure whether it was psychological or in fact real, but he thought he heard the muffled cacklings of the diabolical Clowns echoing throughout the compound’s walls.  It seemed almost suicidal when Depeche thought about it logically, almost suicidal to walk into the most feared place on the island expecting a fair fight.  Especially with the nature of the enemy within.  But no one could afford to think logically to survive these days.</P>
<P>Afghan broke out a crowbar at the door.  It was the first of many buildings, Depeche thought, that would soon be emptied of the Clown filth.  The group had made it it’s sole purpose to infiltrate the Clown compound, and stop the threat that its inhabitants posed to the island itself. Clowns often launched massive raiding parties at defenseless settlements, travelers, and sometimes fragile Miami, now only a shadow of its former self.  It had been the Clowns that had eradicated the settlement where Depeche had grown up in order to raid the storage building’s food reserves that the colonists had grown and harvested.  </P>
<P>Any organized living area outside of Miami suffered without the protection and stability of Miami’s size and population.  Miami wanted nothing to do with protecting or providing for a settlement deep inside the glades.  It had enough troubles of its own.  Rival Desoto, Bahia gangs, Miami Police, and Obeahan people were tearing the city apart.  </P>
<P>Afghan sighed and silently chuckled as he held the severed doorknob in his hand.  He slipped the crowbar and doorknob, now a souvenir, into a side pack and let Depeche step in front. He touched the door and it silently swung open.  Through a pitch black hallway and up a flight of stairs equally dark, Depeche led his group into the doorway to a huge open area.  They looked at what was before them.  A huge ring was in the middle of the building, and a row of old, wooden bleachers near the side.  At the far side of the room, a small risen stage took up most of the wall.  A large lighting array of huge spotlights hung heavily from the ceiling, loaded down with inactive bulbs the size of basketballs.  There was a smell of old, stale popcorn and congealed soft drinks.</P>
<P>They had found the ancient circus arena.</P>
<P>Another hand signal from Depeche sent Afghan and Wilfred to the right, while Depeche and Fixer dashed left.  Behind the bleachers they slowly moved, scanning the area.  Afghan stumbled over spilled Clown Popcorn, ages old and moldy, and sticky soda puddles even older.</P>
<P>&quot;I really, really, hate clowns,&quot; Afghan whispered to his close friend, Wilfred.</P>
<P>&quot;Keep it down, hombre.&quot; Wilfred softly admonished.</P>
<P></P>
<P>Depeche Quadri stepped softly through the small alleyway created behind the raised wooden bleachers and the wall, followed closely by the massive, soft-spoken Fixer Jowe.  Depeche’s heart raced and his senses were supersensitive, as was the tension on his trigger finger.  He had one AK-47 tucked tightly into his underarm.  Suddenly, the huge light array hanging from the roof over the arena flashed to life, and twin spotlights illuminated the two group's positions.</P>
<P>Depeche’s sweaty fingers nearly squeezed precious 7.62mm slugs into the floor.  Couldn’t afford to waste ammo… or life… or good shots at Clown heads.  </P>
<P>Depeche cursed to himself.  They'd been found.</P>
<P></P>
<P>&quot;Move!&quot; Afghan rasped at his companion, shoving him one way as he himself scooted the other.</P>
<P>A rather large clown, with an extended waistline and large puffy hair, humorously waddled out of the shadows into the middle of the ring.  His oversized red shoes clapped the floor resonantly.  The stocky figure was whistling under a clown-colored gas mask.  </P>
<P></P>
<P>"Welcome!  Welcome, ladies and gentlemen!"  </P>
<P>The clown said in a high-pitched, raspy cackle.  And then to Afghan and Wilfred's position:  "Enjoy the show, gents..." he said, and produced a submachine gun with a loaded grenade attachment, pointing it in their direction in the same fluent move.</P>
<P>"Aye Carumba!" Wilfred said, letting loose his own Mega Uzi in a chattering hail of lead.  The clown's grenade hissed off its launching mount, sailing into the bleachers and exploding in a pink cloud of gas.  White-hot bullets pinged violently off the Clown's suit, ripping holes in the outer costume and revealing thick body armor underneath.  </P>
<P>Depeche's own AK-47 sprang to life, plastering the Clown with direct hits.  Undaunted, the Clown turned to Depeche and Fixer's side, and reached to unclip another grenade.  Flashes from ricocheting slugs illuminated his red eyes and disgusting face underneath the gasmask.  The clown wore a stretched, toothy smile, hardly distinguishable from his real smile.  Depeche often wondered if that was the clowns’ real smile.</P>
<P>Now Fixer let his uzi fly, and the bullets bounced off just as easily.  The clown was unscathed!</P>
<P></P>
<P>"Hallugas!  Clear it out, Wilfy!" Afghan said, pushing his portly friend as the pinkish cloud enveloped them.</P>
<P></P>
<P>Fixer leveled out his weapon on the clown's over-exaggerated belly, and spent the clip, the slugs harmlessly bouncing off the clown's chest.  Another grenade hopped off the launcher, and Depeche and Fixer split in opposite directions.  </P>
<P>The grenade pounded the bleachers fogging the other half of the room.</P>
<P></P>

<h2><I><P>Chapter Two</P></h2>
<P>Real Time- Winter 1995  Baton Rouge</P>

<P>Will sat down in his chair, then slid into his normal slouch.  Yawning, he stared at the blank computer screen.  He reached his arm out and flipped the red power switch to his computer.  The computer booted up, as normal, with the orchestra of synchronized wheezes, coughs and beeps that any good 1980s computer had, but then suddenly beeped for about three seconds.  As the screen warmed up, he saw the message:</P>
<FONT FACE="Haettenschweiler"><P>ERROR OR UNAVAILABLE CONFIGURATION DATA</P>
<P>PRESS F1 TO CONTINUE, F2 TO RUN CONFIG DIAGNOSTIC</P>
</FONT><P>Will's eyes sprang open and his head moved close to the monitor.</P>
<I><P>Eroo!?</P>
</I><P>The screen did not answer.  </P>
<P>"Oh great.  Just great."  he said, turning the computer off.  He waited 20 seconds.  "Crap crap crap crap crap crap crap..."</P>
<P>He flipped it on.</P>
<FONT FACE="Haettenschweiler"><P>ERROR OR UNAVAILABLE CONFIGURATION DATA</P>
<P>PRESS F1 TO CONTINUE, F2 TO RUN CONFIG DIAGNOSTIC</P>
<P>YOUR SHOE IS UNTIED </P>

<FONT FACE="Haettenschweiler"><P>JUST KIDDING</P>
<P>ERROR OR UNAVAILABLE CONFIGURATION DATA</P>
<P>PRESS F1 TO CONTINUE, F2 TO RUN CONFIG DIAGNOSTIC</P>
</FONT><P>Will let his head slam into the keyboard.  "Crap crap crap crap crap crap crap crap" he repeated, once again turning it off,  waited an extra 5 seconds, then flipped the switch again.  The computer started to hum back to life.</P>
<P>"No beep.  That's good." he thought to himself.</P>
<FONT FACE="Haettenschweiler"><P>HAH!  I FOOLED YOU!</P>
</FONT><P>&quot;NO!!!"</P>
<FONT FACE="Haettenschweiler"><P>FACE IT, NOT EVEN BEN CAN FIX ME NOW!</P>
</FONT><P>"Auuughhhh!!!"</P>
<P></P>
<P>Will woke up in a cold sweat and looked at his computer.  It lay silent in the moonlight.  He gave off an exasperated sigh and fell back to sleep.</P>
<P></P>
<P>Later That Day</P>
<P></P>
<P>Will stepped up to his computer for a session of Fountain of Dreams.  He clicked the long red power switch.  Only partially flipping it, the hard drive wheezed to life for a second, then died. Flipping the switch again, he grunted in disgust at the stubbornness of the blasted switch.</P>
<P></P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Inside Hyundai 286 Personal Computer</P>
<P></P>
<P>The half-powered surge raced into the delicate circuits, a glitch too small to be controlled but just large enough to do damage.  The powered glitch became alphabetically particular in the micro-processing literature unit, randomly targeting 'M' files.</P>
<P></P>
<P>Florida Island</P>
<P></P>
<P>Suddenly, a multicolored wave of energy zipped into and out of the arena like a horizontal bolt of lightning, illuminating the entire room to a bright-white.  The array of light bulbs shattered in ear-popping explosions, showering the room with tiny shards of glass.  They heard a high-pitched shriek, high even for a Killer Clown, and the energy wave passed through.  </P>
<P>Wilfred was cowering behind a bleacher when suddenly his Mega Uzi shook and rattled n his hand.  The metal became hot, and it burned his hands.  Wilfred instinctively tossed the gun away.  It hit the floor and exploded violently.  Wilfred put his arms up to shield himself and let off a terrifying Obeahan scream.</P>
<P>A main beam crumpled in the north half of the building, and the raised stage collapsed, and the roof fell in onto a third of the end of the building.  </P>
<P></P>
<P>Real Time</P>
<P></P>
<P>Will looked in surprise at the monitor.  A white flash moved from left to right on the screen in the computer's memory checking.  Suddenly, the screen went blank.  A look at the computer told him that the power LED's were also off.  His keyboard's Num Lock light was dead, and all was quiet.  His radio still continued to play softly in the background, as the Condon &amp; Leblanc Afternoon Show wrapped up.</P>
<P>"..Skip Bertman is 'de man for the job...LSU baseball wins 4-0 over...It's those kind of people!!!....hey, 'PRECIATE YOU!"</P>
<P>The 100.7 FM radio station played its demo, and the evening crew came on, starting the next shift with a rock and roll song.</P>
<P>"Oh great," Will said to himself, "Now what have I done?"</P>
<P></P>
<P>Florida Island</P>
<P></P>
<P>As the smoke cleared, there was a white carpet of bulb glass that sparkled in the moonlight shining in from the opened roof.  The light array swung form side to side, crippled.  The clown lay a blackened heap on the ground.</P>
<P>"Fixer, gimme a hand here!" Depeche called to Fixer Jowe, pinned to the floor with an overturned bleacher on the back of his thighs.</P>
<P>Fixer heaved the bleacher off of Depeche's leg, picked up his submachine gun, and began to walk across the ring to the other bleachers.  </P>
<P>&quot;What the hell was that?&quot; Depeche said aloud, brushing dust off his chest.  </P>
<P>Suddenly, there were sounds of high pitched voices and commands outside. </P>
<P>Everyone dropped.  </P>
<P>Hurried footsteps across the gravel, then silence.</P>
<P>Depeche cursed himself for speaking aloud, and crouched low to the ground, resting his assault rifle on the glass-ridden floor.  </P>
<P>He saw Fixer, lying in a crouch in a shadow created by an intact ceiling beam.  The moonlight outside illuminated the rest of the room.  Across the room, he couldn’t see Afghan or Wilfred.  </P>
<P>Depeche slowly got up, walking gingerly on the shatter bulbs.  His ears were still ringing from the terrible sonic onslaught the last couple moments had brought.  The entire structure above and around him seemed to shudder with each of his footsteps.  <I>There was something wrong here,</I> he thought.  He scanned the room and found Wilfred and Afghan on the other side.</P>
<P>Fixer Jowe resettled his equipment and his machetes, and gripped his weapon tightly.  He gathered his nerves, and rose from his hiding stance.  Depeche and the others were gathering toward the door where they had entered.</P>
<P>Suddenly, the world spun about.  Fixer felt numb all over, and his legs were sapped their energy.  </P>
<P>He stopped, and his knees buckled.  </P>
<P>At once, his mind seemed to bend.  </P>
<P>The roof spun about and Fixer stumbled.  </P>
<P>&quot;Must… be… the… gas…&quot; He tried to speak, but he could not force any air through his constricted throat.  A pink elephant strolled across his vision, and Fixer shakily aimed his uzi in the pachyderm's position, and plugged the portly protein-based pigmented pot-belly's personage full of lead.  The rapid recoil of the gun whipped the object away from Fixer's limp hands and fingers.  The bullets sank into the ceiling, and the elephant vanished.  Fixer sank to his wobbly knees, and fell backwards, landing face up in the center of the ring.  His gun crushed pieces of thin glass as it fell.  He lay on his back for several seconds, suffering from a blinding case of vertigo.  </P>
<P>He could suddenly breath, and he began to cough loudly.  </P>
<P>Wilfred's face appeared above his own, whispering in harsh tones, and putting a handkerchief over his mouth to muffle the sound.</P>
<P>"You beez hallucinating, hombre!  Snap out of it.  It's ‘de Killer Clowns silly gas, gettin to ye mind."  Wilfred spoke with his heavy Spanglish accent, made even more incomprehensible with the volume of his voice.  Fixer's watery eyes slowly cleared.  "I'm lucky you didn't mistake my head for ze pink elephant!"  Wilfred whispered, helping him up.</P>
<P>Depeche had managed to cover his nose and mouth with the bright red bandanna he wore around his collar.  He knew that one day the thing would come in handy.  </P>
<P>Afghan stood over the scorched and smoking clown.  Something was missing, but Afghan just couldn't lay his finger on it.  Maybe it was the last of the hallu gas wearing off.  He couldn't figure out why Wilfred wasn't affected.  Maybe it was just being an Obehan.</P>
<P>He thought.  Legs, arms, puffy hair, all there.  Wilfred and Fixer walked up, followed by Depeche, who was walking quite unsteadily.</P>
<P>"Unlucky hombre.  Lost his head.  He was goin loco on us."  Wilfred said about Fixer, still dazed.  </P>
<P>That was it!  Afghan removed the gas mask.</P>
<P>"Whoa dude, the guy did loose his head."  The large clown's hat was empty.</P>
<P>"And his feet too.  He’s gone."  Fixer said, picking up an empty boot.  He dropped it quickly and stumbled to Wilfred to keep balance.  </P>
<P>The clown's metal-frame ringed belly was gone, and now the huge circular ring held up the garment as the costume lay empty on the ground.</P>
<P>&quot;He's gone, dudes." Afghan said, catching on.  Wilfred held up a small card.  It read, "HELLO- MY NAME IS MAURICE!"</P>
<P></P>
<P>2018, New Nevada Desert</P>
<P>Base Cochise</P>
<P>Minutes Earlier</P>
<P></P>
<P>What a cyber geek.</P>
<P>It took little time for every alarm inside Vax to sound off.  He switched his visual input to the base's Holographic Terrain Scanner, but the picture was blinded white.  An electromagnetic scan revealed something quite disturbing.  A huge white energy wall racing from the east toward them, about eight-hundred kilometers away.  Mov sat still at the N.N.N. outlet.  Targeters counted down twenty seconds until impact.  It was moving fast!  The computer estimated ground speed at over 2400 kilometers per second.  Within a millisecond Vax signaled red alert, and the base screamed to life.</P>
<P>The MOTHER channel instantly turned to Vax's position.</P>
<I><P>Vax, series 9000, has summoned the attention of MOTHER.  What is your statement, 9000.</P>
<P>"Energy field detected, moving west at an extremely high speed.  Source: unknown.  Purpose or objective: unknown.  Intentions: unknown.  ETA: nineteen seconds."</I> Vax replied via electronic impulse.  MOTHER computed, thinking at a super-high speed.  </P>
<I><P>Datascan of sensors indicate positive explanation.  Energy field does exist.  Specifications are correct.</I>  The timer reached 0:18.  <I>Response suggested by 9000?</I>  MOTHER asked.  Vax thought.  0:17.</P>
<I><P>"Suggest maximization of protective energy field, solidation and bracing procedures."</I>  0:16.  MOTHER once again computed.  Mov removed his optical scanners from the N.N.N. outlet.  He turned to Vax, about to ask a question.  0:13</P>
<P>Shut off, you stupid cyborg, I'm kind of busy...  Vax thought to himself.  Mov spoke innocently.  </P>
<I><P>"Unit Vax, what is the cause of-"</I> </P>
<P>MOTHER interrupted him.  0:11</P>
<I><P>Suggestion by 9000 accepted.</P>
</I><P>0:10.  Suddenly, the base rumbled as the metal frame was fused together, density increased fourfold.  The shiny metal took on a brilliant luster.  The force barrier began to visibly glow as more than one million volts surged through the projectors.</P>
<P>0:05.  Vax pressed himself into his seat.  He heard a loud rumbling, and the earth trembled around him.</P>
<P>0:02.</P>
<P>&quot;<I>Mov!  Sit down!&quot;</P>
</I><P>0:01.</P>
<P>On the topographical multigrapher, he saw the wave zip over the continent.</P>
<P>KABLAAAMMMM!!!!!</P>
<P></P>
<P>The energy wave smashed into the force field, negating and shattering it.  The projectors lining the perimeter of the base exploded furiously.  There was a hail of smoke that enveloped the dome-like structure.  The reinforced outer hull was rattled as the metal was pulverized, but the field passed through the base in a tenth of a second.</P>
<P>Suddenly, all was quiet.  </P>
<P>Vax looked around, and all of the monitors flashed with static.  Several were completely gutted and smoking.  His circuits whizzed at super-speed, overcharged and straining to keep together.  The MOTHER channel was dead static.  He unplugged his optic sensors from the MOTHER data stream slowly, and his vision cleared.  The conventional halogen lamps were shattered, and emergency LED’s were activated in the floor and ceiling.  </P>
<P>Turning his head, he saw Mov, lying on the floor, smoking and sizzling, his uniball spinning randomly in mid-air.</P>
<I><P>"What a rush..."</I>  Vax audibly thought.  He attempted to make contact with the MOTHER, but the entire channel, and system for that matter, had been silenced.  Mov's two arms slowly pushed the cyborg's body up, and the uniball quickly took hold, adjusting as Mov's internal gyros kicked in.  He spoke.</P>
<I><P>"I....feel.........."</I> He said in a deep metallic tone, and thinking back to the New Nevada Network, <I>"...groovy......"</I>  He flexed his cyber-muscles, embedded deep in the armor of his translucent arms, the adamantium tendon-like cords rising and relaxing as Mov moved them.  The short, oddly-shaped cyborg looked down at his forearms.  In his palms, gouging blades lay sheathed.  These foot-long razor-sharp blades were Mov's only weapon, retractable into the arm under the hands.  </P>
<P>Somehow, Mov had actually realized the Octotron killing machine in him, and forgotten whatever intelligence he had.</P>
<P> &#9;<I>"I....feel......different."</I> </P>
<P>Vax stood up, shakily at first, and as he did, a shrill, ear-piercing alarm sounded from within the heart of Cochise's Geothermal Reactor.  The base was housed atop a major fissure in the tectonic plate below it, and the heat of the earth itself helped power many of Cochise's sentient systems.  But the nuclear reactor served as the source of energy for many systems.  </P>
<P>Radiation alarms added to the chaos.  An automated voice spoke.</P>
<I><P>"All AI evacuate the premises.  Repeat: All AI evacuate the premises.  Radiation may cause: circuitry fusion, depolarization, interference <FONT SIZE=2>and possibly shutdown.  This is the only</FONT><FONT SIZE=1> warning available,</FONT>"</I> the voice said, losing volume. </P>
<P>Vax heeded the alert, grabbed Mov, despite his better judgement, and leaped toward the MOVE.</P>
<P>Hopefully, Mov kept this thing operational.</P>
<P></P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Florida Island</P>
<P></P>
<P>Depeche Quadri looked at what was before him.  Outside the clown compound, Mickey's wall, once a symbol of unity and protection, was gone.  As if some giant had bent over and plucked it off the face of the planet, the thick wall was gone, leaving only a brown strip of soggy dirt outlining the island.  Beyond it, though, was the most surprising thing.  A huge fluorescent and multicolored field, just as high as Mickey's wall used to be.  No one had ever seen it.  It formed a circle around the island, and what they expected to be a beach, maybe some water, was a void of ever-changing light.</P>
<P>"The Outside." Wilfred said, in awe.  Afghan gave him a strange look.</P>
<P>"Whoa, dude, like, you're not gonna get spiritual on us, huh?"</P>
<P>"The Obeah always believe in heaven, but dis, mi hombres, dis is beautiful."</P>
<P>"If this is your idea of heaven," Afghan said, stomping onto the slushy ground and unsticking his damp shirt from his chest, "you're loco, dude." Wilfred was undaunted by Afghan's teases.  Proudly, he started to walk.</P>
<P>"Wilfred, you're not gonna-" Afghan said, stopping in mid sentence.</P>
<P>"Wilfred, I wouldn't suggest it.  It might not be the heaven-" Depeche approached, sized up the situation, and spoke up.  Wilfred turned with a warm smile on his face.</P>
<P>"Hombres!  Obeah heaven is for everyone!  You come, not just de OhOh!" he said, approaching the wall.</P>
<P>"Wilfred, you don't, I mean, we can't be sure-" Depeche tried to say.  Wilfred interrupted.</P>
<P>"<I>I</I> know!" and as he said this, Wilfred turned, and, with the largest smile ever to cross an Obeah's face, walked into the field.</P>
<P>"Wilfred!" Afghan said, moving after him into the wall.  </P>
<P>Fixer Jowe and Depeche Quadri looked at each other.</P>
<P></P>
<P>Same Time- New Nevada Desert</P>
<P></P>
<P>Vax and Mov appeared outside Base Cochise.  The thick, shifty sand gave Mov a little trouble moving, and Vax was straining, but the radiation that now illuminated Base Cochise in the night sky would have done worse, even to a Cochisian cyborg.  The dust had settled around the base like a brown, scorched snow, coating everything.  But then they turned around, looking west, and saw something terrifying.  A huge multicolored wall of light stood, about twenty-five feet high, glowing and flickering on as far as the eye could see north and south.</P>
<P></P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>

<h2><I><P>Chapter Three</P></h2>
<P>Florida Island, Clown Sanctum</P>
<P>Ten feet below the Clown College</P>
</I><P></P>
<P>The name was Crift, and he was the biggest, loudest, and most multicolored clown in the compound.  When he stood, the tip of his multicolored elongated hair wig touched the ceiling.  He who had the taller hair wig was oftentimes commanded the most attention in the Clown society.</P>
<P>"My brothers, and sisters," he said in his deepest, most intimidating voice.  "The last invasion of our territory by the pale-faces did not end as suspected.  Those of you who were in the arena building at the time know fully the shame we all carry because of you.  We have fallen to the sorriest bunch of palefaces ever to venture from The East."  One of the clowns in the back of the small pseudo-bomb-shelter cackled, and Crift raised his left eyebrow almost an entire inch.  </P>
<P>The clown was silenced. </P>
<P>"We have also fallen under the power of a mysterious force which our science department," he said pointing to a small and wrinkled clown in the corner, "has named the M-wave.  This energized wave has seemed to move along and destroy many things that begin with the letter 'M'."  He said this next statement with a tear.  "It has taken our most beloved clowns of Maurice, Minny, Marge, and Macarana...the cute Mexican dancer we all adored, from us… without regret or remorse!  We, the Clowns of Florida Island must avenge them!"  He regained his composure, his puffed chest no longer sagging.  Crift was known for his dramatics.  "We have also suffered the losses of all our Mega Uzi's and Magnificent Meat Dehydrators.  Our science department will now explain."</P>
<P>The small, spectacled man hobbled quite comically up to the podium, his name tag saying, "HELLO- MY NAME IS NORM!"  Norm held a pad of paper and a pen.</P>
<P>"Um, err, yes," he said, collecting his thoughts, "I have a solution to our recent loss of arms.  There is a small hut that used to belong to our friend Maurice.  It held a good amount of ammunition and weapons, that we may be able to use to defeat the threat from the Eastern pale-"</P>
<P>Crift caughed intentionally, interrupting Norm.</P>
<P>"What was the hut called, Norman?" Crift said.</P>
<P>"It was called Maurice's Magnificent Armo-, oh damn.  I believe it should have been destroyed along with the Magnificent Meat Dehydrator, the Marvelous Muscle-toner, the Moravian Magnanimous Microwave, and the Middle-Eastern SCUD Missile Maker.  A shame… too.."</P>
<P>Crift congratulated himself upon catching Norm's error in thinking.  </P>
<P>"Then," Norm said pointedly, "I believe there is only one thing to do.  We must unlock the fury and treasure of our fore-clowns.  For many years we have debated the deployment of the weapon, and now, in our darkest hour, we must strike out with the anger of our ancestors!&quot;</P>
<P>Norm’s staccato and high-pitched voice screeched to its highest volume, cracking noticeably.  </P>
<P>&quot;We must arm ourselves with the Accordion of Devastation!" he said triumphantly, raising a white-gloved finger to the ceiling.  Crift's eyebrows rose as the words ‘Accordion of Devastation’ echoed on whispers in the small room.  </P>
<P>Norm lowered his arm awkwardly. </P>
<P>Another clown, by the name of Tiffany, spoke up.  &quot;What is the Accordion of Devastation?" she said.  Many of the clowns around her gave impatient sighs.</P>
<P>Norm nodded to the clowns' Chief of Armors, Stud, and stood grinning silently.  Stud got up, and, after unlocking a series of safes, padlocks, riddles, and combinations, opened up a small door in the side of the room.  He pulled out an oversized circus accordion, and handed it to Norm, who heaved the object out of the massive Stud's arms.  The large object dwarfed Norm and he struggled to maintain composure.  Fidgeting for the handholds and adjusting the shoulder strap, Norm began to explain.</P>
<P>"Each chord is a different weapon.  For example, open chord would trigger the automatic rifle to fire a burst.  The magazine is stored here, inside the accordion air bag, and holds 60 rounds.  An A would trigger the man catcher to fire, a G would trigger the flamethrower, a G# the taser needle, and a B# will trigger the anti-personnel missile launcher.  Um..er.., although, the anti-personnel missile launcher itself was never installed.  Hmm.."</P>
<P>Norm thought to himself why not, but then looked up at Crift, effectively ending his speech.</P>
<P>All of the clowns, including a flabbergasted Crift, stared in a stupor.  Tiffany broke the silence.</P>
<P>"Whoa...."</P>
<P>Crift popped out of a trance.  "Okay, err, thank you, Science Department.  Now, as for the pale-faces, the Supreme Council of the Clowns," he said looking to his empty chair, "has decided to send a team out to accomplish two things: to eradicate the pale-faces that have infiltrated our abode, and to explore the phenomenon known as the M-wave.  Any questions?"</P>
<P>Tiffany half raised her hand, then put it down with a "nevermind" expression.  More clowns added sighs of contempt. </P>
<P>"This team will consist of four members.  The rest of you will have to stay behind and keep the College running.  Those who remain will repair the damaged Clown Howitzer cannon, man the remaining three turrets, begin to fashion more Mega Uzi's, and repair damage to the Hall of Laughter.  Those who remain are:" Crift read from a long list in his hand, "Elmo, Winnefred, Bouncy, Tug, Elvira, Quincy, Cheerio, Skittles, Nance, Ira, Bing, Bang, and Boom.  Porkler, Lisa, Billy, Bruce, Jenny, Andy, Roger, Dr. Doolittle, Eerie Willy, Kiwi, Joey Auguste, Remi, and Jeffy.  Also staying will be Claude, Roxy, Barry, Wendy, Sully, and Emmy.  The four members of the departing team will be: myself, Stud, Norman, and, despite the best thoughts, wishes, feelings, warnings, better judgment, premonitions and utter nightmares of the Supreme Council, Tiffany." </P>
<P>&quot;<I>Yes!!!&quot; </I>Tiffany hissed to herself, clenching a fist and gritting teeth.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>The remaining clowns sighed relief at not having to venture and risk their own comical </P>
<P>lives.</P>
<P></P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>Five Months Earlier</P>
<P>The Wasteland- Ranger Headquarters</P>
<P></P>
<P>&#9;Jackie Foxer stormed out of the C.L.T.F. room, her face straight and stern, her boots thumping hard on the marble floors and down the gothic hallway that in years past had hosted the Guardians most inner chambers.  Now the Inner Sanctum of the Citadel was a sort of Ranger University, a small schooling facility for advancing rangers like Foxer.  </P>
<P>She was followed a moment later by Commander Avajo Tollack, one of the highest ranking officers at the New Nevada HQ, a tall, broad-shouldered, copper-skinned man.  He slowly stepped out of the doorway, gently closed the door, and straightened his shirt.  He had a grim look on his face.  The testing had not gone well.  Prospective Corporal Jackie Foxer had literally flunked her combat leadership test in the simulator, a sophisticated virtual reality computing system.  Even a bit of tinkering on Tollack's part had not saved the young ranger, or her simulated team of well-armed rangers.  Her electronic companions were gutted by laser fire, and Foxer herself had been electronically ‘killed.’  With a passing of this test she was up for her own squad of Rangers, an all-women ranger crew assembled by Foxer herself.  In memory of the most legendary female ranger yet, Foxer had even nicknamed the group the Christina Corp.  Now the hopes of a solitary command on Foxer’s part were dashed, and a ranking, more experienced officer would have to head up the team.  The rangers in this team weren’t men, obedient, equally physically qualified, or trained as rigorously.  Not necessarily because of their sex but their lack of time in the track; this was the first time enough ranked women rangers were able to be assembled into one team.  </P>
<P>Tollack slowly but steadily walked away from the closed door, pondering his predicament. He heard Foxer slamming the door to the stairwell ahead of him.  Her boots slammed into every step on Jackie’s way down.  Instead of Foxer, someone with equal tact, sensitivity, but stern commanding and excellent strategic commanding skills would need to be chosen.  Someone who could teach as well as lead these young soldiers.  As Tollack thought this, he heard the beginning of a tirade occurring in one of the classrooms.  A large, rough, masculine voice was chewing into a student who had forgotten to account for sandstorms in the deployment of squads, and had then tried to defend himself.  The instructor was shouting loud enough for the words to echo throughout the entire spacious sanctum.</P>
<P>Tollack realized it.</P>
<P>He had found his squad leader.</P>
<P></P>
<P>The Wasteland</P>
<P></P>
<P>Wilfred spat into the sand as he overlooked the landscape.  Some sand had blown right into his awestruck mouth a minute after he arrived, and could not manage to get that salty, dry, dead taste out of his mouth.  The air was very hot and dry, unlike the muggy heat of Florida Island.  He stood disappointed as he looked over an endless, hilly track of sand.  His nose began to bleed, and he squeezed it and patted it with a handkerchief. Seconds later, Depeche Quadri, Fixer Jowe, and Afghan Albert appeared from the glowing barrier.</P>
<P>"Whoa..." Afghan said, standing.</P>
<P>"Madre de Dios." Fixer replied, his eyes lost in the quite unheavenly area surrounding him. For miles, dunes of sand bumped along the terrain.  Wilfred brushed the sand out of his lump of hair and turned back to the wall.  Fixer stopped him.</P>
<P>"I don't think so."</P>
<P>Wilfred looked up in surprise at Fixer's stern objection.  </P>
<P>Depeche spoke up.</P>
<P>"You dragged us out here, you're coming with us.  I don’t think anyone from the island has been here before.  If there is anyone here, we’re just going to do a little diplomacy.  I’d rather have us meeting new peoples than the Clowns.  I’m sure any civilized creature will appreciate us more than those rainbow-colored animals.  Everyone agree?"  Wilfred nodded in reluctant acceptance.</P>
<P>"Now," Depeche said to try to lighten the mood, "let's get walking.&quot; He looked at his watch and adjusted himself according to the compass on the watchband.  &quot;This,&quot; he said, pointing toward the energy wall, &quot;is direct west.&quot;  Now he turned parallel to the wall, facing north.  &quot;As a matter of fact, this wall is perfectly aligned north.&quot;  </P>
<P>Fixer double-checked him, and nodded affirmatively.  </P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>&quot;North, south, or east?  Fixer," Depeche said, "you're a tracker.  Which way to water?"</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>Fixer looked south.  Sand storm.  Can’t even see the horizon.  No problem to us.  East, looks like a city or mountains.  Rockier.  North, that's odd.  A rising smoke column.</P>
<P></P>
<P>North, The Wasteland</P>
<P></P>
<P>Vax looked at the wall again.  What could this be?  Cochise's sensors never picked it up.  We never sent scouts west this far.  And, it's not like it's hard to spot.  A big glowing wall, in the middle of a broiling desert.</P>
<I><P>"Analysis, Vax?"</I>  Mov asked.</P>
<I><P>"I have no clue,"</I> Vax said.  Mov replied with an action.  The half-octotron, half-admin droid rolled unsteadily up to the wall, and with a mechanical SNICKT, popped his right claw.  The shiny blade extended out of the cartridge beneath Mov's wrist, glinting in the sunlight.  He stuck it into the wall.  Right through, without any resistance at all.  Vax reached out his hand, right through the wall, just like a pool of oil back in the lubetech.  Surface sensors on the other side detected moisture variance but similar temperature.  The two droids withdrew their hands, and, with a mechanical SNACKT, Mov's blade sheathed.</P>
<P>Vax thought.   I guess the only reasonable solution to the puzzlement of its existence would be to walk through it.</P>
<P>And he did.</P>
<P></P>
<P>He reappeared in a very different setting.  The air was moist and wet, so damp his armor was covered in a thin coat of condensation.  It was still warm, and a thick, hot breeze swept through what looked like a boxed-in island, surrounded by a similar, but much smaller, flashing-energy wall.  In front of them stood something of a large walled-in compound, with the ancient letters "CLOWN COLLEGE" painted in crusty ink on the wall.</P>
<P>That's odd.  Vax thought.  It's even in English.  Of course, it could be a coincidence.  Vax ran a check of the symbols and their arrangement, through 30 human languages, and could find nothing else coherent.   Mov popped out of the wall, struggling to hold balance.  The moist and loose ground did not do well for a traction-ball.  </P>
<P>Vax heard a noise, and ducked behind a bush.  He dragged Mov behind a thick clump of high shrubs.  Four people approached them.  They looked like humans, although they were dressed in rather strange and colorful clothing.  Their stomachs were bloated and their hair was bleached rainbow colors.  Three men, and one woman, and one of the men was holding a cumbersome instrument of some kind.  Mov said something at low volume about seeing people like them on the N.N.N. one time.  They were called Clowns, and were supposed to be friendly.</P>
<P></P>
<P>Florida Island</P>
<P></P>
<P>Suddenly, Stud stopped in his tracks, the huge accordion rattled.</P>
<P>"What is it, Stud?" Tiffany spoke up.  Stud was almost twice her size.</P>
<P>"I smell...I smell ......oil." he said, sniffing profusely.  "And metal.  Polished metal.  Hmmmm." Stud grunted.  Tiffany sniffed.  She sure didn't hear anything.</P>
<P>"Okay," Crift said, "keep your eyes, or, nose, open.  We might not be the only ones to travel this passageway.&quot;</P>
<P>Suddenly, the entire party heard a splat, like a heavy object falling on mud.</P>
<P></P>
<P>Vax stooped to pick Mov up after he had slipped in an especially damp place.  </P>
<I><P>"You should have been an admin."</I> Vax whispered, <I>"switch on your camouflage circuitry and shut up."</P>
</I><P></P>
<P>Crift pierced the surrounding bushes with outlined eyes.  He still couldn't see anything.  Wait, something just moved.  In the dusk sun, a glint of sleek metal caught his eye.</P>
<P></P>
<P>Vax's body was a perfect replica of the environment, and Mov's skin was also the mixed green and brown color.  Vax unhooked his laser rifle, just in case.  Then he realized, he may have just doomed them.  The long rifle, shining off the setting sun, unplugged from its stasis conduit on Vax’s hip, was unaffected by the camouflage circuitry in Vax's pseudo-skin.  </P>
<P></P>
<P>"There," Crift said, his nine millimeter Browning automatic handgun clicking against the long ammo chain on his chest as he pulled it out of its arm-pit holster.</P>
<P>"In the bushes," he motioned.  </P>
<P>&quot;Come on you old coot.&quot; Norm shakily loaded his rusty Remington 700 rifle.  He'd never used it before in combat, but had never failed to keep it polished or oiled.  He spoke,</P>
<P>"Wh...who...who are they, Crift?" he said nervously.</P>
<P>"I don't know.."</P>
<P></P>
<P>Mov analyzed the four figures in the foggy clearing.  At low volume, he spoke.</P>
<I><P>"The leader is holding a short-range single-chambered primitive low-caliber pistol, bullets are aged condensed lead.  Relatively harmless to most of our armor.  The shorter, elder one is holding a similar-tech long-barreled bolt-action weapon, longer range, still mostly ineffective against us.  The larger one is holding a multi-function disguised weapon, containing a rapid-fire multi-barrel auto-feeding slug-throwing weapon, a napalm-igniting flamethrower with a static fuse, and small net, fired by a gas pressure burst.  All except for the flamethrower, which can cause damage to optical circuits, are virtually ineffective against our armor.  The female appears to have a small satchel of chemically-charged pyrotechnics in the form of small round balls triggered by a timed explosion. These hand grenades pose no critical threat to us."</P>
</I><P>Vax turned his head and looked in awe at Mov's analysis.  He'd have never noticed the small holes in the large music instrument, or the slight infra-red chemical activity in the form of small spherical objects in the book sack of the woman.  Mov was a war machine.  He had been built so, but not it seemed that Mov had switched programs.  No longer was a scientist.  Ever since that energy wave rolled through, Mov hasn't said one annoying thing yet.</P>
<I><P>"Predicted possible outcome of confrontation = victory in a maximum of five minutes."</P>
</I><P>Mov means to slaughter these humans!  He will not! </P>
<I><P>"Mov, listen to me, we will not instigate an attack.  We play defensive!"</P>
<P>"No need to instigate, Vax, my friend…"</P>
</I><P></P>
<P>Crift popped an extra clip into the two-pack clip case in his handgun.  <I>I may need this,</I> he thought, as he noticed the huge, metallic rifle in the midst of the leaves.  He gulped and took a deep breath, shivering inside with anxiety.  A sudden gust of tropic wind made the large palms sway, only for a second.  Crift saw enough of the camouflaged man and his weapon to see a good fight.   He started to walk forward and was trying to clear his parched throat.</P>
<P>But Crift was not the only one who saw the accidental show of firepower.  Norman saw the gun, and panicked.  </P>
<P>&#9;&quot;Oh boy oh boy oh boy…&quot; he muttered worriedly.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>He shakily leveled out his rifle, and squeezed back the trigger.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>"Norm, no!"</P>
<P>The slug exploded from the barrel.</P>
<P></P>
<P>Mov saw the small bullet spin into loaded position and hit the hammer.  Mov saw it spin in the grooves of the barrel, racing through the tight confines of the gun barrel.  Mov saw the bullet explode out of the gun's tip at more than 1500 feet per second.  Mov saw it split the leaf in front of him and then felt it ding harmlessly off the top of his shoulder plate, whistling happily through the energy wall behind him.</P>
<P>Octotron instinct kicked in.  In twin SNICKT's, Mov's serrated knives popped out and he propelled himself via a hydraulic spring into the air, trajectory aimed for the only human that could actually affect him.</P>
<P></P>
<P>"Norm, no!" Crift said, and grabbed the barrel of Norman's gun and pointed it down a split-second to late.  They all heard a metal-on-metal <I>ping! </I>and everyone turned to the foliage in surprise.  A huge, green machine erupted from the bushes, arcing up and heading toward Stud.</P>
<P>Stud grunted an exclamatory grunt and managed to peel off three rounds from the machine gun, but the adamantine blades still sailed toward their mark.  Stud was slammed to the ground under the immense weight of the green attacker, but fired three more times at less than one-foot's distance, each bullet dinging off the breastplate of the strange machine.  On the bottom of the tall body was a black rollerball, like a ball-point pen, and two massive arms were beneath the squat head.  Mov’s twin talons found their mark easily, and plunged straight into the Accordion of Devastation.  The two blades jammed solidly into the metal workings within.</P>
<P>The inch-thick steel plate covering Stud's front was the only thing between the two blades and his flesh.  Stud let go of the Accordion of Devastation and grabbed the creature's smooth metal arms with meaty hands.  He looked into the red, glowing, inhuman eyes, seeing a human non-human inside.  He shook the vision out of his head heaved the robot off of him, and, with a fear-instilled blast of adrenaline, brought his feet squarely into the robot’s chest.  Shoving with all his might, Stud dislodged the Accordion and tossed the robot straight through the glittering energy wall, ten feet away.</P>
<P></P>
<P>Vax looked in horror as his partner plunged into battle with blades drawn, and then in sheer amazement as the tall, massive one hurled the pseudo-Octotron straight through the energy field.</P>
<P></P>
<P>20 Klicks West of Las Vegas</P>
<P></P>
<P>Sergeant Slaughter, US Ranger Corp, looked over his crew with hands at his hips.  Beady eyes pierced the avoiding eyes of each of his cadets.  Slaughter's incredible biceps bulged out of the sleeves of the military green button-down.  In his shiny silver Raybans, his ranger corp saw themselves standing shamefully before him.  The hot desert sun drew a single bead of sweat off of Slaughter’s forehead as he began to speak.</P>
<P>"Pathetic, you lousy piles of Rad Rat terds!  Those Vegan scumbag Sniperdroids got the complete jump on my elite and skilled group of Desert Rangers!  How do you expect me to train the five most helpless pieces of bat fettish on the entire desert!?!" He billowed, saliva spewing out of each consonant.  His Ranger Squad stood, cowering below his incredible stature.</P>
<P>As the Sergeant billowed on, Jackie Foxer stood and tried to mute out the Sergeant.  Jackie had always dreamed of being a ranger, ever since she was rescued by Jax Ylanndian and Christina herself over twenty years ago.  Now she nearly regretted the decision.</P>
<P>The sergeant was now giving Jackie’s best friend Rachel Folsum a speech on the accuracy of her gunfire.  Jackie was hardly listening, along with the rest of the crew, but she was sure Rachel was in utter hell.  She tried to defend herself, but the sergeant dug in only deeper.  <I>That girl has to learn to keep her trap shut…</P>
</I><P>&quot;Close?  Close, Folsum?  You shot out the windows of some poor beggar’s shack!  Close doesn’t cut it!  Close only counts in horseshoes and hand grenades, <I>not</I> seven-point-six-two bullets!&quot;</P>
<P>He finished with Rachel, and moved down the line.</P>
<P>"FOXER!  You slacking pile of lizard shrat!  You call yourself a Ranger!  That sniperdroid could have taken off your head!  Hey, are you listening to me, pond scum!?"</P>
<P>"Yes, sir!"  She wasn’t completely truthful.</P>
<P>"Do you know what you did wrong, you pile of rotten Drool eggs!?"</P>
<P>"No, sir!"  She wasn’t at all truthful.</P>
<P>"You didn't watch your team’s flank!  You didn't check your weapon!..." Slaughter spouted off a list of seven 'text book' mistakes Foxer had committed.  </P>
<P>&quot;No <I>wonder</I> you didn’t get corp-&quot; </P>
<P>The anger began to flare up in Jackie’s cheeks.</P>
<P>Suddenly, the phone rang.</P>
<P>The emotion was temporarily abated.</P>
<P>Jackie hated when he brought that up.  That was personal.</P>
<P>Rudely interrupted and slightly annoyed, Sergeant Slaughter yanked the cellular receiver from his Shadowclaw-skin belt.</P>
<P>"Slaughter here!" he blared.  "80 Klicks east Vegas..." It was always good ranger code practice to multiply the actual mileage by the date, which was August 4, and reverse the compass direction when conversing over insecure radio frequencies. Although they were 20 klicks west...  "You what!?!........Are you kidding!?!  With these--........!?!......But sir, Tollack’s men could surely…….Uh huh......Uh huh.......Uh huh.......No sir..... Cochise!  Hah!  These punks couldn't--.......No sir.......Yes, captain......No, sir......No, sir.......Our best, sir......Yes, sir!!"</P>
<P>He turned the phone off, and, after a second of mental preparation, spoke in a milder tone.</P>
<P>"All right, you filthy flak-fish eggs.  The captain back at HQ has ordered us to investigate a disturbance over at Cochise, supposedly related to the recent Energy Wave.  They can't spare any other men...er...rangers...for this mission, with the defense of the Quartz station from the rival gangs, as well as building the air field in the Ag Center.  Since the choppers aren't able to fly the dust storms that the Ag Center is taking now, Ranger Corp has to investigate by ground.  That means us.  He obviously thinks differently of you, because I wouldn't send you pieces of shrat anywhere north of Vegas!&quot;  Slaughter clapped his phone back into its holster/charger on his belt and cracked his knuckles.  &quot;Bumper!" he said, directing his sound blasts in Kerry Bumper's direction, "break out the Westchesters!   Folsum!  Get that laser pistol of yours working!  Everybody, assault prep!  NOW!"</P>
<P></P>
<P>62 Klicks West of Vegas</P>
<P></P>
<P>Depeche wiped the sweat off of his brow.  This heat, it wasn't like anything he'd ever experienced back in Florida.  Unlike Floridian heat, this was dry, cracking, and burning at his throat and nose.  As soon as he got back he would think differently about the humid, sweaty air.  After walking for about three hours, his party stopped in the shade of an oasis.  It seemed that the desert was dying off and some vegetation was beginning to sprout up.  The party was holding up well, no major problems with the heat beside a bit of dehydration on Afghan's part.  They had a nasty fight with some rabies-stricken dogs, luckily no one was seriously wounded.  Wilfred had pity on the insane canines and gave them a decent burial, difficult as it was though with Fixer making such a mess of one of them.  But, what was this place?  Why were they still exploring a seemlessly uninhabited land?  Life most certainly existed, here.  Human life, for that matter, was also a certainty.  The party had spied a dust-ridden and empty box of cigarettes in the sand, most likely carried over many miles through sand storm winds.</P>
<P>Our physical health may be good, but morale is low, Depeche thought.  I want to turn back.  There's no reason not to.  He called his foursome together.</P>
<P>"Okay.  Listen up.  I know this may not be paradise, but there's some point to this place's existence.  We just haven’t found it yet.  There may yet be civilization east, but at this rate,&quot; he said shaking a half-filled canteen, &quot;it won’t be long before we run out of rations.  Of course, trying to get back may also be a problem."</P>
<P>&quot;I know dude.  We’re already drinking our reserve water right now.&quot;  Afghan said.</P>
<P>&quot;So what it is, guys.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;What do you think, Depeche?&quot;  Afghan asked.</P>
<P>Depeche exhaled slowly and scanned the horizon again, turning in a circle.  Living in the confines of the island never prepared him for the limitless boundary of the true desert sky.  It wasn’t claustrophobia… it was the other way around.  He was excited by the near infinite possibility of such a horizon, but still afraid of its emptiness.  From his companion’s expressions, Depeche knew what he felt was not unique.  They had all grown up on the island, there was no other place to grow up.  The wall sealed the island off, and the sea would make it even tougher to get out or in… but there was no sea!  Only the shimmering vertical plane.  Had it always been that way?  Or maybe just that side of the island.  </P>
<P>What now?  Explore this limitless landscape, or return disappointed to discover that his island in a deep blue sky was an island in a small cage. </P>
<P>&quot;I don’t know.  There’s so much to find out either way.&quot;  Depeche had forgotten about the low rations.  </P>
<P>"Hombres, I know that I may have been the reason for us to come here, but I now want to be the reason to go back.  ‘Dis land is not as much of hot and sweaty as it’s a heresy.  ‘Dis is no heaven.  I vote d’return and see what ‘dis big change may have done ta our own land.  For all we know, ‘dis dry desert wasteland may have ad’one point been lush and live like ours."  Wilfred spoke sincerely, disappointedly. </P>
<P>"Me too.  Er.. I mean, I want to go back too." Afghan said, his cheeks white and pale, holding a canteen in his hand, wiping some of the water off his chin.</P>
<P>Depeche emitted a short recognition grunt and tightened his backpack.  He was gratified that the decision had been made.  Still elated at the prospect of exploration, Depeche started west promptly.  </P>
<P>A cloud of awkwardness descended on the remaining three, who soon followed suit.</P>
<P></P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The Wasteland</P>
<P></P>
<P>Sergeant Slaughter had spied the four men walking eastward through binoculars, but of recent they turned around and moved westward.  <I>So, they're running from us</I>, he thought.  They could be terrorists from the west planning to sack Vegas, but trucked it back when they saw rangers.  They could be smugglers, assassins, gangsters, or, even worse, vegetarians.  <I>Oooo, I hate vegetarians,</I> he thought to himself.  Whoever they were, they were gonna meet with the biggest, baddest Ranger of all time, Sergeant Slaughter.  Even if they were going back west.  Out into the middle of the desert.  Where nothing can live.</P>
<P>It then struck Slaughter.  West of Vegas was nothing but uninhabitable desert wastes!   Sure, a hundred miles northwest was the bit of vegetation in the mountains that encompassed Cochise, and about three hundred south was the tiny settlement at Savage Village,<I> but otherwise, nothin’!   </I>So where were these guys coming from?  And now, going to where?</P>
<P>&#9;It was Jackie Foxer who pointed out on the dusty rangers’ map the high alcoves at the Meso Canyon, not really a canyon but a high, craggy rocksides partitioned by a smooth, sloping desert trail.  &quot;Biologically useless, but strategically unbeatable.  If they are ruffians running from the uniform, sir,&quot; Foxer proudly noted, &quot;that’s a damn good place as any to camp out.&quot;</P>
<P>&#9;The sergeant raised an eyebrow and grunted an optimistic grunt.  </P>
<P>&#9;&quot;Well, Foxer.  Looks like you found something.  ‘Bout time you did something right.&quot; The Sergeant noted half-heartedly.  He looked down a Jackie, only slightly daunted from the insult.  He suddenly felt benevolent.  &quot;But when it rains, it pours, kiddo.&quot;  He clapped her on the back and sent her on her way, then futily tried to fold up the map.  </P>
<P>&#9;Jackie has a good head on her shoulders, he thought to himself.  I just hope she doesn’t have to prove it yet.  <I>Still a bit wet under the ears, </I>he duly noted to himself, and trudged off to get one of the rangers to fold the map for him.</P>
<P>&#9;</P>
<P></P>
<P>The Wasteland, 10 Klicks East of the Energy Wall</P>
<P></P>
<P>Depeche had noticed the six soldier-looking men heading east.  The six uniformed men, one of who was especially tall, had been gaining on them.  Without changing pace and looking suspicious, the uniformed men would be on top of them in no time, sooner than they can get to the energy wall.</P>
<P>Depeche had a plan.  Up ahead, there were some rocky hills, which they had camped in last night, perfect for hiding in.  If the party slowed, the team would reach the rocks about nightfall.  If they could hide in them, these pursuers would give no trouble at all.  Unless, ofcourse, they asked for it.</P>

<P>The MOTHER computer reached full function. </P>
<P>The MOTHER system survived through the M-specific Energy wave strike without any physical damage.  The actual hardware of the MOTHER system was guarded heavily by electromagnetic, and radiation shields, but still, most of the computer's memory was wiped, but was slowly being restored by hard copy.  Otherwise all systems were back on line.  The trioptics, which are thin cables lining all the walls of the base itself, feed the MOTHER processor all information about the base.  The trioptics lace almost every square inch of the matter making up the compound, giving MOTHER information in the forms of heat displacement, photoreflection, and EM displacement.  This makes everything moving (since all matter displaces the EM spectrum), perceptible to MOTHER.    </P>
<P>Several groups of Octotrons and Vanadium Vultures were down, and several others were missing, including, Vax and Mov. </P>

<h2><I><P>Chapter Four</P></h2>
<P>Near the Meso Canyons, 100 Clicks West of Vegas</P>
</I><P></P>
<P>That night, Depeche located the best spots for his team to hide.  Through infra-red binoculars, Sergeant Slaughter watched them, settling down in high rock crevices, moving up the tall cliffsides to hide behind jutting rocks and dead plants.</P>
<P>"Alright me-, er, women!" he shouted, "Tomorrow we are going to execute a hunt-down-and-acquire maneuver in yonder rocks!&quot; Slaughter shoved his thumbs under his belt at his sides.   &quot;Do you hear me?  Execute, by definition, means to successfully accomplish without error!  That means no screw-ups!  I want everyone on AK-97's just in case these buggers put up a fight!  Understood?!?"</P>
<P>"Yes sir!"  The reply came in unison.</P>
<P>"Good!  We rise a daybreak!"</P>
<P></P>
<P>10 Klicks South of Base Cochise</P>
<P></P>
<P>As metal hit sand, an A65Alpha Steel Reaver stepped out of a hovering ShadowCopter, running fully on VectorSensors without the aid of visual topography.  There was a tremendous sand column forming in the pressure cyclone the huge black ShadowCopter was creating above itself.  Two silvery Steel Reavers followed the first, stepping onto the sand and walking briskly.  The ShadowCopter's low thup-thup-thup of rotating blades intensified, and the craft rose up and away, leaving a dying cloud of sand behind.  </P>
<P>The three cyborg stalkers known as A65Alpha Steel Reavers treaded across the burning desert sand.  Tall, silver, and vaguely humanoid, the Reavers were the foremost all-around fighting machine in Cochise's arsenal.  Each Reaver was armed with a heavy-duty Particle Beam rifle in the right arm, and an electrified glove on the other.  Sensory perception was thermoscanner, VectorSensor scanners, and there was a sixteen-point turbo-targeter used to aim the rifle.  The Reavers' exoskeleton was a tough carbon steel alloy, polished to mirror-like perfection.  </P>
<P>The Reavers, code-named Putt, Amuck, and their leader, Frup, were the only editions of the A65A Class, which was known to be the closest mental capacity to a human ever electronically reached.  MOTHER had worked long and hard on these, arming them with the best human-reactive programming that MOTHER had developed so far. </P>
<P>The series A65A was also known for the human-like sense of futility, and the three Reavers were used only in non-combat missions, like their current mission: to locate and retrieve designate 9000: Vax.</P>
<P></P>
<P>Florida Island</P>
<P></P>
<P>Vax saw the remaining humans move toward his position in the soggy ground foliage.  He, not wanting to be forced to inflict damage to them, shouldered his rifle, and leapt for the wall.  He burst out of the foliage and raced across the dead ground with superhuman speed and agility.  In a flash of light he reappeared on the other side, about five feet away Mov, who lay on the ground, trackball spinning in an effort to upright itself.</P>
<P>"Come on Mov, let's move!" Vax said, grabbing the fallen robot's arm, and, with cyborg strength, lifting the heavy Mov up his feet.  Mov uprighted himself, and began to follow Vax, who was running eastward, away from the energy wall, energy rifle slung across his back.</P>
<P>Vax scampered over the first foothill, lost his footing in the shifting sands and fell, sliding down the small incline, and came to rest at the bottom of a five-foot hill.  The winds must have picked up, Vax thought to himself, these dunes were not as high as the usually are.  What I wouldn't give for Cochise's Meteorological Unit right now, or even a pair of VectorSensors.  </P>
<P>The thought now occurred.</P>
<P>Maybe MOTHER has fixed up the radiation damage by now, and, without any other major problems, the base should be fully operational by now.  Shouldn't it?  Maybe I should head back.  No, MOTHER would send out scouts to find me.  But what if MOTHER can't?  Was I the only one who walked out on the Base?  MOTHER might not need Mov, but MOTHER needs me.</P>
<P>Mov slipped clumsily over the same dune, and landed right next to Vax, still sprawled in the shifting sand.  Vax got up, and turned to Mov, trying futily to upright himself.  It was then he noticed it.  </P>
<P>A small, almost unnoticeable mark on Mov's indestructible back, as if some corrosive or acid charred it's way straight through his armor.  With a closer look, Vax saw that the mark was a hole, straight through the armor, burning through Mov's batteries.  This is bad, very, very bad. The hole seemed to be slowly enlarging, discoloring the metal around it.  And another oddity, it was in the exact center of Mov's squat body, burning straight through the metal.  The batteries couldn't be producing this acid.  Cochisian batteries don't use corrosives and acids any more.</P>
<I><P>"Mov, get up."</I> Vax said.  <I>"Look at my back."</I>  Vax helped Mov up, and then turned.  &quot;<I>Mov, do you see anything- any marks, a hole perhaps?&quot;</P>
<P>"Why..Vax...you have....a hole....."</P>
<P>"Where?"</P>
<P>".....in.....your....back...."</P>
<P>"I know that, stupid robot.  And what's wrong with your speech?"</P>
<P>"There.....seems.....to.....be.....a....malfunction....in......my....vocal.....system.  Cannot.....speak......correctly.  Shutting....off...vocal system."</P>
<P>"No!  Mov!  Where is the hole in my back?"</P>
</I><P> &#9;Mov's voice system audibly crackled and buzzed, but still managed to make out three final words, until the audial speaker clicked off.</P>
<I><P>"Exact.....geometric.....center....."</P>
</I><P></P>
<P>Florida Island</P>
<P></P>
<P>Crift looked in astonishment at his chief of arms, who just lofted a metallic killing robot-thingy into mid-air, ten feet or more through the wall.  Stud had almost the same astonishment, and looked at his hands in disbelief.</P>
<P>Norman held his head low, holding his rifle in his hands.</P>
<P>"Whoa, like, cool move, Stud." Tiffany spoke.</P>
<P>"Thanks." Stud half-understandably said.  Stud had had speech difficulties ever since he accidentally downed a bottle of Coca Cola-colored motor oil.</P>
<P>Crift brought the attention of the group back to himself.</P>
<P>"Okay guys... and gal.  We now know what kind of opposition we'll get, and it seems we will handle it very well.  Norm, just don't fire unless I tell you to, or you'll have latrine duty for another month when we return."  Norm gulped, and slung his rifle over his shoulder, tightening the strap, and hoping never to have to untighten it.  "Let's press onward."</P>
<P></P>
<P>The clowns moved through the wall.</P>
<P></P>
<P>Meso Canyons</P>
<P></P>
<P>Depeche crouched down low in the small path dug into the rocks.  About five feet below was the path that the men would travel through.  Once again, the team had split up, with Fixer Jowe and Depeche Quadri on one side of the path, and Wilfred and Afghan Albert on the other side.  Depeche had positioned his crew as far away as possible, at the most westward end of the rocky path, in hopes that the enemy would get used to seeing blank, enemyless rocks, walking in from the east.</P>
<P></P>
<P>Half An Hour Later, Meso Canyons</P>
<P></P>
<P>"You talk too much." Fixer grunted, talking only six inches from Sergeant Slaughter's mouth.</P>
<P>"I am an American citizen!  You can’t do this to me!  We are United States Army Corp Rangers of New Nevada!  Untie us at once!"</P>
<P>"I'm gonna say this one more time," Fixer said to Slaughter tied up along with the rest of his Rangers on the rocky ground, "stop yappin' or Mr. Machete here," he said, unsheathing the dark blade, "is gonna take over.  Mr. Machete isn't as patient as I am."</P>
<P>Fixer was hating the baby sitting Depeche had assigned him.  The large, gruff, spike-haired one would just not shut up.</P>
<P>"You!  Hey you!" Slaughter yelled to Depeche.  "Get your half-minded psychopath away from me and let me loose!  NOW!"</P>
<P>Depeche ignored the Sergeant's harsh shouts, and kept talking to Afghan.  Sergeant Slaughter sat on the ground, a rope coiled three times around his torso, with the female rangers behind him also held in the loop.</P>
<P>"Afghan, they are human beings."</P>
<P>"Depeche, they tracked us, hunted us, and that lady over there nicked me with a pretty little light-shooter-"</P>
<FONT SIZE=2><P>"You lousy spinach-downing ruffians!"</P>
</FONT><P>"Yeah, but they were only trying to make us come down from the rocks."</P>
<P>"But they were gonna kill us if I hadn't singed 'em a little with my flamethrower!" Afghan patted his warm napalm-holder.  </P>
<FONT SIZE=2><P>"You dirty rotten, lettuce-scarfing, tomato-chewing, no good VEGETARIANS!"</FONT>  </P>
<P>&quot;That big guy is really getting on my nerves, too, Depeche!  Come on!&quot;</P>
<P>Depeche folded his arms and sighed.  He turned and moved to Slaughter.  The burly sergeant quieted down, seeing that he had finally gotten some results.</P>
<P>"If you don't stop running your mouth, I'll take my vegetarian fist and make you a raw knuckle sandwich, hear?  And, for your information, a tomato is a fruit.  <FONT SIZE=2>At least in my neck of the woods.</FONT>"</P>
<P>Depeche never really figured out where that expression came from, since he had never seen any woods, but added it anyway for emphasis, right before stuffing a sock into the sergeant's mouth and moved to rejoin Afghan and Wilfred.</P>
<P>"What do you make of the weapon, Wilfred?" Depeche asked, pointing to the laser pistol the stocky cultist was holding.</P>
<P>"A weapon that shoots light.  That's all.  I don' know how many shots it has, or how far it goes, but I can shoot it, hombre.  ‘nd ‘dat, my friend, is worth respecktin’.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I agree, maybe one of the women would explain it to us.  I don’t trust the big guy.&quot;  Afghan said, eager to meet the females under less combative terms.</P>
<P>Afghan picked up a small arms launcher from the pile of pilfered arms, and set it on his shoulder.  The long cylinder was desert camouflaged, and there was a sizable adapter on the back.</P>
<P>"I can use this, dudes.  It’ll fire just about anything you stick in it that has its own rocket.  I saw one back in Miami.  One of the Bahia punks picked one off a Clown.&quot;  He smiled, his yellow teeth showing.  &quot;All I need now is some-  of these-" he said, holding up a large satchel of Westchester rocket propelled grenades, RPG's.  "These I can definitely use." He loaded one it and pointed it in Depeche’s unamused direction.</P>
<P>&quot;Bang.&quot;</P>
<P>Depeche’s weary gaze moved to Fixer as he joined the group.  </P>
<P>&quot;I do not like the him.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;We know.  But unless we can get some cooperation from them none of us are going anywhere soon.  We can’t just leave them out here.&quot;</P>
<P></P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Depeche finished divvying up the loot by handing Fixer the last remaining weapon.  Fixer audibly <I>ooed</I> as he gripped the thirty pound Vegan Proton Axe, with the word "Slaughter" inscribed on the hilt.  Its aquamarine blade faintly glowing, attached to a carbonadium tungsten hilt, the double-bladed razor sharp Proton Axe moved with fluentness as Fixer swung in slow motion toward an invisible enemy.</P>
<P>"Groovy," Fixer grunted. </P>
<P>"Put down my axe!  If I ever get my hands on your filthy-"</P>
<P>"You won't," Fixer cut him off abruptly, moving the blue blade close enough so that the sparking blue energy nipped at Slaughter's puffy mustache, "don't worry."</P>
<P>Depeche laid a hand on Fixer's shoulder, giving him the well-worn and commonly used 'don't chop his head off, buddy, we need him,' look, and knelt down to Slaughter's level.  The other desert rangers behind Slaughter relaxed, thankful that there had been no bloodshed.</P>
<P>"Okay, mister, I have a proposition for you.  Now, before doing anything stupid, notice the irate, ax-wielding maniac glaring at you from over my shoulder."</P>
<P>Slaughter gulped.</P>
<P>"Where we come from, we usually scalp and gut our prisoners," Depeche said with a toothy smile, "but, I'm in an especially benevolent mood, so you won't be loosing the very little hair you have left."  Depeche rubbed Slaughter's buzz cut, against the grain.  Slaughter hated that.  He flexed his muscles and leaned forward toward Depeche, and the rangers behind him yelped as the ropes tightened.</P>
<P>"Now, I'm a rather intelligent person, and, I figured, you're not carrying around all this pretty weaponry for rat hunting.  Tell me, what kind of creatures could you need to fight with this kind of fire-power?"</P>
<P></P>
<P>The Energy Wall</P>
<P></P>
<P>Crift, Norman, Stud, and Tiffany took a wiff of the hot, dry, desert air.  After several minutes of staring in awe at the yellow desert, Crift snapped out of the trance.</P>
<P>It was so big.  There was no Mickey’s wall, comfortably guarding what them from the infinite expansion of Earth.  For the first time in his life, Crift saw the horizon, a sharp but blurry line between the deep blue sky and the golden sand.</P>
<P>"Uh, okay Clowns, let's go find that...that......thing.  Yeah, that thing."  Crift said, trying and failing for the 'get-up-and-go with chins high' pep talk.  Norm spoke up.</P>
<P>"Is that them?" he asked, pointing northward about half a mile or so.  Crift turned and refocused.  <I>Great, now the mood is really ruined</I>, he thought.  Sure enough, two figures, one choppily scooting on a black ball, were moving northward.</P>
<P>"Okay...Clowns...let's move out." Crift said, flabbergasted and confused.  He didn't think it would be that easy to locate the enemies, and was hoping to show off his desert tracking skills that surely he thought he had.  </P>
<P>Stud now wielded a machine gun, ripped from the gutted remains of the Accordion.  It was pitifully undersized for Stud’s massive hands, but would have to suffice.  Stud ripped out the clip and reloaded the bullets it had expended, jamming it back into place with a definitive clap.</P>
<P>&quot;No.&quot; Crift said in response.  &quot;Last time is was clearly obvious that the bullets were of no use but to incite or distract them.  However,&quot; he made a move toward Tiffany.  &quot;These will surely be able to dent them, so use them.  This however,&quot; he said, sticking his finger in the barrel of Norm’s rifle, &quot;won’t do crap.&quot;  He pulled his finger out of the nozzle with some difficulty, and changed disposition.  Norm looked up with an innocent, close-mouthed grin.  &quot;So you,&quot; Crift said as he moved closer, almost directly in front of, &quot;you will not shoot unless instructed.  And if you do shoot,&quot; he grabbed the scrawny clown’s collar, and heaved him up in the air, shaking him with each repeated: &quot;<I>always, always, always </I>KILL!!&quot;  Norm’s glasses fell to the sand.  &quot;GOT IT?!&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Yes, Crift!&quot; the raised-up scientist half-spoke, half-cried.  Norm’s feet dangled above the ground and his hands grabbed desperately onto Crift’s forearm.</P>
<P>&quot;Good!&quot; </P>
<P></P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Eastward</P>
<P></P>
<P>Vax stared in horror at the barren wasteland as from behind him Mov's hot-wired, debilitated voicebox managed to articulate, "expanding......one.... mill- mill-  -.......<I>crackle</I>....millimeter.....<I>hisspop poppop</I>.....per min-..min...<I>cracklepopcrackle</I>"  Vax listened as Mov, reported the news.  Mov's voicebox was a tangle of wires Vax had done a crude makeshift job on, but was getting steadily worse as the strange hole in his back widened.  </P>
<P>"Mov, we gotta move, and quickly." Vax said over his shoulder.</P>
<P>"<I>hisscrackle</I>...affirm<I>cracklecrackle</I>ative......"</P>
<P>&quot;Go ahead and switch off the power to the voicebox and reroute to the self-maintenance systems.  Keep yourself cool.  This heat will melt you down.&quot;</P>
<P>Vax got up and began to walk when he felt that something in his system was wrong, too.  Already the structural integrity of his armor had disabled the chameleon circuits.  A self-diagnostic at maximum level not only detected the breech in outer armor, but a malfunction in the circuitry coolant\heating system.</P>
<P>This is very, very bad.  Pretty soon, I'll be glued stiff in this heat without my coolant system.  Mov and I have to make it to Cochise pronto, and if they can't help us....</P>

<P>The Reavers detected a robot system.  Complex, high-powered and multi-wave energy circuits creating intense, low-frequency microwave heat were easy to detect with Cochisian Thermal VectorSensors, even at the tremendous distance.  Putt even got an ID on the signal, a Cochisian modified Octotron.  No sign of Vax's thermosignature either.  The Reavers would easily be able to pick out Vax's normal heat signature even in this desert heat.  Vax's signature was considerably lower than the desert's, thanks to the copious intercoolers all admin robots had.  While the desert soared at about 120 degrees, Vax would be hovering around 65 or 70.  Frup decided, after more detailed long-range scans, that the strange, damaged Octotron was not worth pursuing, for it would be in range of nominal Cochisian sensors in no time.  Anyway, an Admin droid like Vax would probably head more eastward, where temperatures were more manageable and detection by Cochisian forces was easier.  Admin droids had the tendency to do that, and sometimes it got them killed.</P>
<P>Frup stopped, relayed his decision to the others, and the three turned south-eastward exactly 15 degrees.</P>
<P></P>
<P>Vax and Mov</P>
<P></P>
<P>The heat is beginning to congeal my servomotor coolant into gel.  My body temperature is almost as high as the desert's is, and my limbs are slowly stiffening.  We must keep going, MOTHER is only 50 miles north-northwest.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Meso Canyons</P>
<P></P>
<P>Depeche Quadri, Fixer Jowe, and Afghan Albert, listened to Sergeant Slaughter with interest.  Wilfred stood at the top of the tallest rock with a pair of the Rangers' Binoculars.</P>
<P>Introductions were made between each ranger and Floridian, so the mood was somewhat more relaxed.  The sergeant explained to Depeche and the others about his world.</P>
<P>"This place is called the Wasteland, New Nevada.  New Nevada’s this semi-state made up of basically the big radioactive desert you see here.&quot;  The sergeant scratched his head, &quot;That a ways’ the only source of year-round water, a tributary of the Colorado river.  You say you're from Florida?  For a bunch of green-horns, you're a long way from home.  My party is from a large group of military personnel known as the Rangers, and we keep this desert in order.</P>
<P>"We've been sent by Ranger HQ to investigate some disturbances to the north of here, created by a place known only as Base Cochise.  The entire complex is run by a very advanced and sophisticated computer called 'MOTHER'."</P>
<P>"What's a computer, dude?" asked Afghan.  </P>
<P>Slaughter saw his chance to intimidate these ignorants.  It was like fresh recruits from the eastern desert.  They knew nothing.</P>
<P>"A highly complex, intelligent and deadly device of unknown origin.  It controls multiple killing machines that run wild in the desert, killing anything that moves, especially humans.  Indestructible hides, and, do you know that light gun over there?  These machines carry weapons a hundred times as powerful."  Slaughter thought to himself: Well, not too far from the truth, but convincing all the same.  &quot;Think of a computer as a human brain with more efficient, quicker, and more accurate metal components.&quot;</P>
<P>"So, Slaughter, have you faced these killing machines," Depeche asked skeptically, "or is your story a pile of Dobermutant crap?"</P>
<P>Slaughter had no idea what a Dobermutant was, but he got the point.</P>
<P>&quot;Are you doubting me?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Only speculating.&quot; Depeche said.  He often acted as not only the groups’ unnamed  leader, but the only talking member of any situation involving verbal warfare.</P>
<P>"I've taken a couple Reavers my time."</P>
<P>"Reavers.  These killing machines are called Reavers?"</P>
<P>"<I>Right</I>..."</P>
<P></P>
<P>&#9;Afghan Albert sat on a smooth rock, his arms on his knees, his weapon leaning at his side.  The Sergeant, who had become less and less aggressive towards the others, had taken to talking more quietly and privately with Depeche.   The Floridian’s fearless leader had on his genuine &quot;tell me more&quot; face.  <I>I swear</I>, Afghan thought to himself, <I>Depeche reminds me of a little kid.  The guy is curious, smart, sharp, and stubborn.  </P>
</I><P>&#9;Afghan surveyed the rest of the Rangers.  The ropes had been untied in the spirit of open friendliness, and the rest of the Rangers, all female, were standing in a loose circle, talking quietly and waiting for Sergeant Slaughter to finish.  He noticed their professional-looking uniforms, like ones he’d only seen in picture books.  He noticed their fine-fitting boots, probably kevlar.  <I>These chicas are for real.  And look at the guns!</I><FONT SIZE=2>  </FONT>Afghan examined the AK-97 assault rifles slung on the backs of the Rangers. </P>
<I><P>Oh shoot… shoot.. shoot!  Stay calm…</P>
</I><P>&#9;Kerry Bumper sauntered to Afghan’s seat.  Afghan put the side of his head on knee, then picked it up and ran his fingers through his hair while nervously glancing at the rocks in the surrounding cliffs, trying desperately not to appear aware of the woman’s approach.</P>
<P>&#9;&quot;I noticed you were staring in our direction.  I also happened to notice that my automatic weapon is bigger than yours.  Now that <I>that</I> is clear, is there anything you’d like to say?&quot;</P>
<P>&#9;&quot;Well I ah never meant to I wasn’t really looking at you in general, you know.  You know.&quot;  Afghan nervously blurted and tried to avoid eye contact.  </P>
<P>&#9;&quot;Stand up.&quot;</P>
<P>&#9;Afghan promptly obeyed, jamming his hands in his pockets.  His flamethrower fell and hit the ground, and made him jump in surprise.  He clumsily bent down and reset it back on the rock, then stood back up and jammed his hands back down his pant pockets.</P>
<P>&#9;&quot;Yeah?&quot;</P>
<P>&#9;Kerry suddenly slung her assault rifle at arms length, shoulder eye, and leveled it on Afghan’s nose.  </P>
<P>&#9;Afghan froze and stared right down the barrel.  <I>Oh crap!  Oh crap!  What did I do?!  What did I do now!?</P>
<P>&#9;</I>Kerry held the rifle level for a moment, then lowered it.  </P>
<P>&#9;There wasn’t a magazine clip in it.  Just an empty socket right in front of the trigger.</P>
<P>&#9;&quot;You didn’t even notice that my gun wasn’t loaded. You really aren’t from around here, are you?&quot;</P>
<P>&#9;&quot;No, no, not really.  I’d say that’s a safe bet.&quot;</P>
<P>&#9;Kerry cocked her head to the side and slung her rifle around her shoulder.  She smiled with half her mouth, the way she always did.  She extended an outstretched hand.</P>
<P>&#9;&quot;Kerry Bumper.  Nice to meet you.&quot;  </P>
<P>&#9;&quot;Yeah, sure, right!  Right.  Afghan Albert, nice to meet you too, m’am.&quot;  Afghan shook her hand with a little confidence.  &quot;You’re right, I’m from Florida.  Not the desert.  Florida.&quot;  </P>
<P>&#9;&quot;Florida?&quot;  Kerry raised her eyebrows.</P>
<P>&#9;&quot;Yeah it’s that way.&quot;  Afghan pointed westward.  &quot;Not far.  A day or two on foot.&quot;</P>
<P>&#9;&quot;Uh huh…&quot;</P>
<P>&#9;&quot;Well, you know, the whole glowing wall and everything.&quot;</P>
<P>&#9;&quot;Glowing wall?&quot;</P>
<P>&#9;&quot;Oh, man… nevermind.  Talk to Depeche.  I’m sure he’d be able to explain it.&quot;</P>
<P>&#9;&quot;No, no.  I want to hear it from you.  Florida, last time I checked, was almost 2000 miles that way,&quot; she pointed east. </P>
<P>&#9;&quot;Yeah, yeah, I’m sure it is.&quot;  Afghan tried to picture the continent in his head, or at least what he remembered from the old books.  Aside from a crowded home and meager food, education was the best thing his single mother could have ever given him.  But those days were far away, and the information he earnestly wanted access to know was no where to be found.  </P>
<P>&quot;But we walked through this glowing wall and all of a sudden it’s dry and sandy and we’re all getting bloody noses and there’s sand everywhere and NO water at all.&quot;</P>
<P>&#9;&quot;Holy crud.  Holy freaking crud.  You guys aren’t from around here at all.&quot;</P>
<P>&#9;Afghan bent down and scooped up some dry sand in his hand.  It sifted through his hands smoothly.   </P>
<P>&#9;&quot;Yeah.  I guess you could say that.&quot;</P>
<P></P>
<P>Above</P>
<P></P>
<P>Wilfred did another scan of the dusty horizon with Depeche's pair of binoculars.  Nothing. But, as Depeche said, just in case.  What a heaven, Wilfred thought.  Nothing but dirt and rocks and these military freaks.  Maybe Depeche had sent Wilfred up here so he wouldn't have to hear the terrible truths of the land he had called heaven.  In a way, Wilfred was thankful.  He was overly convinced that this new land was not his religion's promised land.  But Depeche had wisely judged that Wilfred didn’t need to be reminded of it rudely again by talking to a native of the land. It was like Big Daddy used to say back in Miami, "Some things, dey better left unsayed."  </P>
<P>Big Daddy also once said, "don't go walking in some stranger's boots...you never know how often he washed his feet..."  Somehow, Wilfred said to himself, the aforementioned thought had to have some relevance to his current train of mind.</P>
<P>Wilfred hadn't taken anything from the poor 'rangers' other than the light-blasting weapon Depeche ordered him to keep, and the three packs of ammunition for it.  As far as Wilfred thought, we had no business capturing and looting these uniformed people.  Obviously they were serving a higher authority.  In only taken what was required of him, he felt he still retained some respect for the native inhabitants.  </P>
<P>Wilfred blew his bangs off his eyebrows and sighed.  In a small pile of sand in between to rocks he saw a small insect burrow its way out of sight.  In only a few inches of sand, this creature finds a home.  If only the little animal knew how much bigger the world was, and that it was not restricted to a small pile of sand and the surrounding inches.  Wilfred put himself into perspective, and gazed across the endless desert.  He remembered something an old Obeahan had once told him.  It’s purpose was to teach humility.  &quot;The solar system is made up of nine planets, and we live on a small part of one.  The galaxy is made up of millions of planets, and we live on a small part of one.  The universe is made of an infinite amount of planets, so you better damn well be sure you be happy right where you are, because only right there is where you can call home.&quot;  </P>
<P>&quot;And this small part of one,&quot; Wilfred murmured quietly to himself, &quot;is not my heaven.&quot;</P>
<P>Out of Wilfred’s peripheral vision he caught a flash of light.  He put the binoculars up to</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>his eyes again.  His jaw dropped.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>"Madre de Dios..."</P>
<P></P>
<P>Below</P>
<P></P>
<P>"And what's this?"</P>
<P>"This here's is a communicator.  Anyone who has another something like this can talk to you if you have one of these.  Watch," Slaughter said, grabbing the radio out of Depeche's hands. Perfect. <I> These strangers are such idiots.  I just contact HQ and...</P>
</I><P>"Not so fast." Depeche said, snatching it back from the Sergeant just as the huge man turned it on.  The little machine gave off a loud crackle and snap, like old Rice Krispies.  Depeche, Afghan and Fixer jumped at the alien outburst of sound.  Slaughter grabbed the radio back.</P>
<P>"Fine," he said, turning it off and throwing it back into the pile of ranger goodies.  "What more do you want from me?"</P>
<P>"What about that light-shooter?" Afghan asked.  He turned up to Wilfred's position to call him down, but Wilfred was already racing down the rocky hillside.</P>
<P> "Hombres!" Wilfred cried out.  His foot caught a rock, and Wilfred slid down on his paunchy belly to the foot of the rocky incline.  Not minding the assorted scratches and bruises on his arms and chest, he stood up and spoke.</P>
<P>"Angels!"</P>
<P>"What?" Depeche and Slaughter said in unison.  The frantic Wilfred ran up to Depeche.  "Angels!  Seraphim!  Whadever!!  Three silver men with armor!"</P>
<P>"Wilfred calm down, dude.  You're turning red. Have a drink." Afghan said, chuckling and offering the stocky Obeahan some water.  "Maybe it was just a mira-"</P>
<P>Sergeant Slaughter interrupted rudely.</P>
<P>"They're humanoid?"</P>
<P>"Yes," Wilfred replied, catching his breath.</P>
<P>"Silver armor?"</P>
<P>"Yes..." was the response again.</P>
<P>"Holding weapons?"</P>
<P>"Yeah, they sorta look like rifles."</P>
<P>"There's three?"</P>
<P>Wilfred held out his hand and touched his pinky, ring, and middle finger.</P>
<P>"Yeah."</P>
<P>"Reavers," Slaughter concluded, without any uncertainty.</P>
<P>"Are you sure," Depeche queried.</P>
<P>"No doubt.  Standard Cochisian intercept squad of three Beta Class Steel Reavers."  Slaughter was almost as worried as the Floridians were now.  He'd never really faced a Reaver before, much less three of them.  He'd only seen a pseudo-autopsy of one in the Citadellian labs.  Those machines are complex inside, even Ranger tecchies were astounded.  <I>Lotsa firepower, too.</P>
</I><P>"We gotta arm ourselves.  And my troops, truck 'em south, back to HQ.  Any Reavers this far away from Cochise can mean only one thing."</P>
<P>Depeche queried only with eyebrows.</P>
<P>"MOTHER has finally declared war."</P>
<P></P>
<P>Frup, Putt, and Amuck</P>
<P></P>
<P>Amuck "heard" it first.  A slight, almost non-existent static burst in mid-frequency FM echoed into the cyborgs' VectorSensors.  It lasted only a matter of seconds, and was so localized and controlled it must be man, or cyborg-made.  This was information enough to make the three Reavers once again change course.  They changed course, charged their weapons, and changed to full-alert battle mode.  FM frequency 98.6, (formerly UDED), was only used by Rangers.</P>
<P></P>
<P>15 Clicks South of Base Cochise, Near the Energy Wall</P>
<P></P>
<P>The Clowns finally caught up to the two androids.  After stalking them for the last 35 miles, the team of comical Clowns jumped up from all sides, spraying Vax and Mov with ammunition.  Tiffany perfectly laid two of her best grenades on either side of the rolling one, and the Octotron plopped to the ground.  Another grenade exploded in mid-air near Vax’s face.  Vax managed only to detonate his emergency beacon and chemstun field as the blast shattered his optical sensors.  The surrounding thirty meters was bathed in a second-long dampening field, and all chemical reactions halted.  The first thing to go was the life forms.  Crift, Norman, Stud, and Tiffany felt their insides painfully grinding to a halt, and each dropped into a deep, sedated sleep.  Next to go was the droid's power sources, and, for the quick duration, the two died.</P>
<P>The generators quickly sparked back to life in the abused systems of the two cyborgs, and Vax sat up after collapsing to the ground.  He shakily did a systems diagnostic, which showed a very poor but regenerating power budget, a destroyed optical system, a useless coolant\heating coils system, and an armor breech in the back plating.</P>
<P>Mov woke up as well.  His optical sensors were still functional.  But a systems check was as equally disturbing as Vax's.  The speech\vocals system was completely off-line, communications system was beginning to show problems, and a chunk of shrapnel from the woman's pyrotechnics was wedged between the rollerball and the casing, completely blocking off the roller's movement.  What was left of his transmissions system detected that Vax had activated the emergency beacon.  Mov swiveled to see Vax fidgeting around.  Admin droids were especially helpless without optic sensors. <I> </I>And, as Mov thought to himself, Octotrons are especially useless on the ground.</P>
<P></P>
<P>Meso Canyons</P>
<P></P>
<P>"Foxer, I know I've been kinda hard on ya lately," the Sergeant said, "but if you get these soldiers back to the Citadel, I guarantee you'll be a Lance Corporal in no time."</P>
<P>"Yes sir!"</P>
<P>"I want you to avoid confrontation at all costs.  Remember, your team is very weak.........ly armed.  <FONT SIZE=2>Don't want another one of those sexism lawsuits again.</FONT>  So, knowing this, be cautious, keep to the deep desert, and avoid the river, only at the bridge."</P>
<P>"Yes sir!"</P>
<P>"And don't try to contact me!  If you have any problems, contact the Quartz Ranger station.  But remember, Cochise is on the move, and you're the only one who knows.  I want you to tell Tollack to his face.  No radios unless its necessary, r’you hearing me, bub?"</P>
<P>"Yes sir!"</P>
<P>"Now get outta here.  Oh, and, watch your flank, you filthy ragweed piece of android fodder."</P>
<P>Jackie Foxer knew that androids didn't make fodder, but she took Slaughter's advice and orders, and moved with the rest of the rangers south, into the searing desert.  She hoped Slaughter would be okay, as well as his lightly-armed group of strangers.  Slaughter turned back to his new-found allies, who were loading up AK-97 assault rifles.</P>
<P>As the rangers moved south, Slaughter had checked for himself through binoculars at the Reavers almost a mile away.  Slaughter scanned the rocky terrain facing north.  Several naturally formed gullies and crevaces would serve as excellent sniping positions.  Afghan seemed adept at firing AT weapons, but the others don’t.  We don’t want any rockets missing and sending up dust clouds… so Afghan and I will fire the Westchesters… we can take out one of them for sure.  Better go for two of them.  The last can be debilitated at best by rifle fire.  The laser pistol’s range was too limited to be of use.  It won’t take long for either of us to reload, and we can finish of the last one together.</P>
<P>This is, ofcourse, taking into account that the Reavers don’t fire back.  Reavers hardly ever miss.  The  sergeant reviewed his plan and talk to the group.</P>
<P>&quot;Okay, friends.  Here’s the plan.&quot;</P>
<P></P>
<P>Vax and Mov</P>
<P></P>
<P>Vax struggled northward, moving only with the vision of a pathetically weak radar scanner and under the weight of Mov, holding on to his shoulders.</P>
<P>Vax was in pitiful condition.  Joint heat strain was three levels over the required maximum heat measure, and his power failures had intermittently begun to shut of optic scanners (useless anyway), defensive scanners (no more targeting the old MX5000), defensive measures (chemstun and weapons recharge outlet off line), and the regenerative cyberpatch system (that hole will get alot bigger, alot quicker, without me fighting it).</P>
<P>Mov was in pretty bad condition too.  Along with the muted speech system and the bummed transportation mode, his batteries were down, and solar absorbers had to be engaged to keep himself 'alive'.  Mov's transmissions system was also off line, so Vax couldn't talk to Mov through radio even if he tried.</P>
<P>Vax looked ahead with limited radar scanners.  A dust storm, low to the ground, was gathering north of them in the thinning desert.  Vax lowered his head and concentrated as much on the sand underfoot as he could.  The dust storm would soon come and numb even radar visibility.  His processor network had to constantly readjust balance levels, and this workload was drawing substantial energy from Vax’s own banks.  </P>
<P>Using his best estimate of their position, they were at least twenty-three hours away from the base at this very speed, twenty-two hours away from manual radio transmission.  If the storm picked up speed, Vax could be forced to stall for hours without solar energy coverage.  </P>
<P>Suddenly, overhead, both droids heard a very familiar, and quite relieving sound.  Mov looked up, to the shiny underside of a Cochisian ShadowCopter reflected in the low sun, as the low putt-putt-putt of the chromium blades raised a whirlwind of yellow sand. That had been no sandstorm!  ShadowCopters, finally coming to rescue us.  And not a minute too soon!  The next thing Mov felt, was being toted by a pair of CyTechs into Cochise Repairs.</P>
<P></P>
<P>Meso Canyons, North Side</P>
<P></P>
<P>Afghan Albert and Sergeant Slaughter knelt in a small, weathered-away ditch, where the annual spring rain storm drained out of the mountains.  This year had been especially dry, and the rocky ditch was flaking and parched, the bits of hardened sediment cracking like a mutant spider web.</P>
<P>On each man's right shoulder lay a hollow, gray metal tube, open at both ends, with a red, egg-shaped object stuck in the front.</P>
<P>Better known to rangers as Westchester 500 RPG's and launchers.</P>
<P>In the North River skirmishes about three years ago between rangers and Alpha class Reavers, Westchester 500's had bored multiple holes in multiple Cochisian hides.  The rangers had won that battle, at the expense of several dozens of good rangers.  Cochise had not moved out from its mountainous alcove until now.</P>
<P>Invisible laser targeters, undetectable to even VectorSensors, highlighted Amuck's and Putt's sleek, stubby and armored heads.  There were only seconds between ignition of the RPG's rocket and detonation of the warhead upon impact as, from a higher angle, Wilfred, Fixer Jowe, and Depeche opened up with Laser Pistol and assault rifles.</P>
<P> </P>
<P>Frup could only watch in cybernetic horror as his two partners' heads blasted open revealing a sparking myriad of yellow, red, and green wires, gadgets, gizmos, and other cyborg parts.  What followed was a hellish storm of depleted uranium 7.62  and 9 millimeter bullets and fiery red laser flashes that rained down on him and his fallen comrades.  The twin impacts knocked Frup to the soft ground.</P>
<P></P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<h2><I><P>Chapter Five</P></h2>
<P>Meso Canyons</P>
</I><P></P>
<P>It was all too much for Frup, the only remaining Cochisian A65Alpha Steel Reaver.  Amuck's deactivated shell burst apart, the armor blasting away from the ravaged torso and showering the area with cyborg parts.  Putt's headless body collapsed to its knees and then flat on its chest.  Sensory information and intrinsic programming met.</P>
<P>Frup turned and ran.</P>
<P></P>
<P>"What the?!?" Sergeant Slaughter proclaimed as the target in his sights turned and dashed away.  He lowered his launcher to view it through his own eyes.  The Westchester 500 hummed in impatience, and so did Slaughter's trigger finger.  A Cochisian Steel Reaver, fully armed and targeted, had turned its tail and fled.</P>
<P>He knew that a Reaver, especially an Alpha class, would continue to fight even if a hundred of its kind were destroyed.  Rangers had inserted a Reaver's brain into a combat scenario, to see how it would act in different situations.  One of the North River Reaver's metallic carcasses was recovered in decent condition.  The tests had shown that it would take a Martian invasion fleet that wiped out twenty identical Reavers beside it to make the Reaver flee.  And the robot's mind deliberated that decision ten times over.</P>
<P>"It must be a ploy.  Keep firing!" Slaughter said.  Next to him, Afghan heeded the advice and let his RPG sail.</P>
<P></P>
<I><P>Impending impact.  Seek cover immediately.</I>  Frup's non-concious program warned him, and the conscious program heeded it's advice.  Frup's silver plated body leaped sideways and down, just missing the streaking shell as it burrowed into the sand and exploded.  A huge sand column erupted from the desert's hilly ground.</P>
<P>Frup dislodged a piece of shrapnel from his chest.  The hole immediately began to spark with the regenerative cybernetic program's activation.  He rolled again, back into the sand column's core, and propped his left arm’s particle beam rifle on the newly formed sand.  VectorSensors began to work through the swirling cloud, outlining small, hot infrared sources.</P>
<P></P>
<P>Afghan cursed himself.  He really didn't know just how the shell missed, but not only was the Reaver alive, but it was perfectly shielded.</P>
<P>From across the rocks, Fixer gave Afghan a disappointed but encouraging look.  Depeche whipped out a pair of binoculars, and attempted to pierce the cloud visually.  Wilfred still held his laser pistol at arms' length, still a bit worried that he had just entered combat with the immortal warring angels of the Conqueroo.  But these creatures exploded, and died.  Either they weren't the angels of the Conqueroo, or the old Conquerooster was loosing his touch.</P>
<P></P>
<P>50 Meters Above Base Cochise</P>
<P></P>
<P>The ShadowCopter hovered over the shiny, dome-shaped structure known as Base Cochise.  The ShadowCopter flaunted three huge air-to-ground missiles on each side, and a Potassium-Proton Carbine below the sleek nose.  The huge blades had a diameter of almost 16 meters, spinning so fast that all five rotors blended together in a large gray circle above the craft.  A bay door growled and ground open on the flattop of Cochise's top level, and the ShadowCopter dropped down into the hangar beneath.</P>
<P>The ShadowCopter set down on retractable skids next to a pair of smaller, sleeker Cochisian jet-powered fighters, and one bulky Cochisian Bomber.</P>
<P></P>
<P>Later</P>
<P></P>
<P>Vax’s autonomous thought while inside the Cybertech repair tube, whose intricate arms moved rapidly replacing damage parts and recharging his reactor and batteries.  Using logic-step cause-effect reasoning, he pondered. The holes appeared as Mov and I entered the desert.  We entered the desert because of the M-specific energy wave.  The energy wave forced us to get out as quickly as possible, so, we used...the MOVE.</P>
<P>That's it! The MOVE disassembles molecules into an electronic symbol, transmits them, and then reassembles them...from the outside in.  The MOVE had to have been affected by the M-wave, right?  But the MOVE is incredibly complex, almost as complex as MOTHER's system is, so the M-wave's effect wasn't as serious.  It reassembled us correctly at first, but began to malfunction and failed to reassemble us toward the middle.</P>
<P>Vax required extensive repairs to his entire body-wide movement centers, for thick, black, and gooey lubrication liquid, once an almost frictionless, clear, and water-like substance, clung to joints and actuators, and infected other systems.  New optical sensors and a modified set of VectorSensors were also added to Vax's headpiece, and the entire coolant\heating system was replaced.</P>
<P>The back plate in Mov's armor had a three-inch wide hole.  A new transmission center, a new vocals box, a new battery coupling, and fresh fusion batteries were installed, as well as new back and front armor plates.  A five-inch long piece of twisted shrapnel was removed from an abused rollerball, and scorch marks from the explosions of the two grenades were polished off.</P>
<P>The MOTHER computer, as Vax discovered, was very different as well.  Because of its name, MOTHER was forever changed.  The computer seemed to be suffering from amnesia, which was slowly being restored as hard copies of all information was re-read by MOTHER's data processors.  The M-wave did not harm the computer, though, merely sent her into a state of submission for an unknown amount of time, which, in turn, erased most of its memory.  The MOVE machine, apparently, after transporting Vax and Mov away, sputtered and exploded, leaving the main control room buried under an inch of delicate matter processors and energy warpers.</P>
<P></P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>A message hit to low-frequency FM receivers mounted on the crown of sensors on the top of Base Cochise, and the information sped through MOTHER's processors.</P>

<P></P>
<P>The Reaver’s VectorSensors locked on to a target.  Telescopic mode engaged, and a large, massive humanoid heat source glowed with targeted radiance.  Through the thinning sand Frup isolated its target braced for recoil.</P>
<P>Frup squeezed off one high-powered burst, turned, and sprinted north.</P>
<P></P>
<P>"Arrrggghhh!!!" cried Sergeant Slaughter.  Fixer Jowe touched the cleansing pad to the deep, puffy energy burn in Slaughter's left shoulder.</P>
<P>"I've never seen any wound like it.  It cauterized immediately and then started to swell.  All I know to do is clean it."</P>
<P>The wound was just next to the clavicle, splitting open the flesh but luckily not harming the bone or major muscle tissue.  Just as the dust cloud was intensified by a sudden gust of wind, the Reaver took a potshot with a particle beam cannon at the Rangers beginning to leave the hills.  Slaughter was grazed by the blast, and the rest of the team had time only to crouch down and burn three or four more rounds.  After sweeping the area with binoculars when the dust cleared, Depeche saw only the dissipating trail of fast-moving footprints heading northward.</P>
<P>"Aggghhhh!!!" cried Slaughter again, as Fixer applied a medicated XXX band aid to the Sergeant's arm.</P>
<P></P>
<P>Near Energy Wall, South of Cochise</P>
<P></P>
<P>Frup knelt down behind a sand dune to examine the new life forms he had found.  Such strange creatures, but still intelligent.  Definitely mutant, he thought.  Discolored skin and hair, apparently bipedal and humanoid, but mannerisms and body proportions are distorted.  </P>
<P>The four clowns had only minutes ago stirred from their unconscious state, and Frup had been silent, observing the whole time.  He had walked up on these life forms on his return trip to Cochise.  These new creatures would be excellent specimens for the biolab, and they are each so different.  Frup adjusted as the sand eroded away beneath him in the desert wind.</P>
<P></P>
<P>"Did you hear that?" Stud asked aloud.  He was the first one to have awakened.</P>
<P>"What?" Tiffany replied.</P>
<P>"Sounded like another machine movement."</P>
<P>"I didn't hear anything."</P>
<P>Norm joined the conversation.</P>
<P>"I have to disagree.  I heard a sound that may have been produced by the very metallic men we have been fighting."</P>
<P>"I didn't hear anything either.  Ignore it." Crift said.  Stud ignored his leaders command\reply.</P>
<P>"To arms." Stud said, heaving his weapon to readiness.  His fingers habitually slipped into the position.</P>
<P></P>
<P>They now are brandishing weapons.  <I>Fascinating ones, each creature has its own unique and specialized weapon.  Mainly chemical solid propellant slug throwers, like the weapon the large human is carrying.  The female has a gathering of explosives, and the old one has a long barreled slug-thrower, meant for long-range accurate fire.  The last has a small, compact, multiple-shot slug-thrower.  All these weapons are different model but similar to the primitive non-energy weapons rangers and desert commons use.</P>
</I><P>Frup, upon remembering MOTHER's instructions to bring back to Cochise all his findings, stood up clearly into view, waving both arms, one a particle beam rifle, and spoke.</P>
<P>"Lifeforms of the wasteland!  Please follow me!"</P>
<P></P>
<P>Crift looked in awe at the seven-foot tall metallic man, whose entire left arm was a long-barreled weapon.  The humanoid’s broad shoulders were almost three feet across.  Even Stud was surprised at the size and massiveness, as well as complete surprise of the machine.</P>
<P>"Do you have a leader, lifeforms?"</P>
<P>Crift stepped forward.</P>
<P>"I am, err," Crift stuttered.  He had never talked to one of the killing machines.  "Who are you?"</P>
<P>"I am Frup of Cochise, an installment north of here.  If you would accompany me there-"</P>
<P>"For what reason?"</P>
<I><P>These humans were quick-witted.</P>
</I><P>"For biological study, and full recharging...healing." Frup had to correct himself, and be pleasing to the creatures.  They had weapons whose firepower Frup could not predict.  &quot;We wish to… exchange knowledge and protocol.&quot;</P>
<P>Crift looked to Norm.</P>
<P></P>
<P>Cochise</P>
<P></P>
<P>Vax sat at his station in the Cochisian control room, being fed monitoring information while MOTHER was using most of her resources to rebuild her mangled memory system.  New flaws had been found in the system...deleted files were restored, some made even by the creator many years back, and some system programs were erased or altered, including all of the security locks and electronic checkpoints.  Vax finished the latest production check... MOTHER had increased the production of Alpha Class Reavers, while decreasing resources toward sciences robots.  Repair units were also being mass produced, more than had been, and a program had been issued to develop a detectionless propulsion system for the ShadowCopters. </P>
<P>Vax now moved onto sorting and pitching the old files that had surfaced.  Somehow, MOTHER's system stored these files, and were uprooted by the energy wave.</P>
<P>Fascinating.  This document seems to be a personal file...typed in code.  No problem decoding it. Vax's newly installed code-cracker software buzzed right through the human-created code.  Those humans never did have a knack for encryptions.  Vax read, and was amazed.  The personal transcriptions of the creator’s voice logs were listed.</P>

<FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=3><P>VOCAL LOG OF J.I. FINSTER</P>
<P>RECORDED ON T.I. 202 MULTIPURPOSE SERIAL# 46221013</P>
<P></P>
<I><P>January 12, 2005- 14:32</I>-  "One day, the small chip I have forged will grow into a huge, sentient entity, controlling minions of its own make and model.  By then I will be long gone, but my masterpiece will flourish, rebuilding the planet.  It may cost lives, but my ideal with grow and branch with the integrated circuits, eventually obtaining sentience, and it's goal of cosmic importance.  The race we are needs guidance, unbiased and just, with an iron, nay, titanium hand, from a third party, incapable of error or misjudgment.  The computer will carry my cause throughout, conquering with power unheard of to man or mutant.  &lt;pause&gt; A rebuilt planet will evolve from the nuclear pyre like the mythological phoenix, &lt;long pause&gt; an image of heaven.&quot;</P>
<I><P>October 14, 2007- 22:13</I>- "The location I have chosen will suit the growing machination well.  The geothermal rift is obliquely shaped in the crevice below the surface.  As tangible proof of Cochise’s superiority and ingenuity, the base will soon be able to channel the power below for an dauntless supply of energy.  &lt;pause&gt; The first laser-based weaponry has been developed, using next-generation chemical batteries and refined common crystals found in the mountainous soil.&quot;</P>
<I><P>December 2, 2007- 02:59</I>-  &quot;The base has chosen a shape for itself: a hemisphere.  As the base geometrically expands in size, the computer and thermal core will become more and more protected and shielded.  &quot;</P>
<I><P>March 9, 2008- 07:41</I>- &quot;The phenomenon humans vainly attempted to master, nuclear fusion, my brainchild has contained and reduced in the size of a golf ball.&quot;</P>
<I><P>November 29, 2009- 07:30-</I> &quot;Construction has now turned to the earth below.  Several levels  have expanded below, fitting nicely in between thick layers of volcanic granite.  A particle accelerator has been constructed.  Although it lacks the size and unwieldliness of the Fermi Lab tubes in southern Illinois, this lab has begun to isolate the location of the elemental super-stability number.   In a few short weeks, it predicts, element number 121, according to the human Periodic Table, will be isolated and methods to reproduce it in substantial levels will soon be attained.&quot;</P>
<I><P>May 31, 2010- 02:59-</I> &quot;The main computer system reached self-awareness several years ago, but until now has still been somewhat slave to my demands to fields of scientific study.  Claiming that the prototype reactors are leaking residual alpha radiation, the main sentience unit, now referring to itself as MOTHER, has asked me to relocate my corporal entity.  Whether or not this claim is factual, I suppose I will never know.  However, I will soon be saying goodbye to my home of many years.  I will venture out into the void again, that massive expanse infected with the disease of humankind.&quot;</P>
<I><P>June 3, 2010- 10:13- </I>&quot;Last night I was attacked by several mutant wolves.  Although I managed to kill each beast with my laser pistol, I have several wounds on my legs and arms that are extremely gory.  Augh… I have in my time in Cochise forgotten the color of blood, the smell of flesh, the sensation of sweat and solar radiance.  It is very unpleasant.&quot;</P>
<I><P>June 3, 2010- 3:37- </I>&quot;I am becoming very weak.  The magnetic repulsion rover Cochise provided me with has also malfunctioned, &lt;pause&gt;, leaving me to continue on by foot. &quot;</P>
<I><P>June 4, 2010- 00:12- </I>&quot;I do not remember the events since my last log.  I can only presume Cochise deployed a rescue squad to recover my near life-less body.   I appear to be in a room inside Cochise I am not familiar with.  Perhaps a medical bay, since I am lying on a medical table and several mechanized instruments are shut down around me.  In the few days I have been gone I doubt that such rapid construction could have taken place.  I am now almost certain that MOTHER has been deceiving me, and has been operating independently for more time than I was aware.&quot;</P>
<I><P>June 4, 2010- 02:32- </I>&quot;MOTHER has changed me.  A medical cyborg entered the room shortly after my last log as the room filled with a colorless but far from scentless gas.  Agreeably, the human senses of smell and taste are very complex indeed.  The complexities of the human brain took billions of years of biological evolution to create, surely even MOTHER will not be able to master it for a comparable time of several decades.  Although that supposition to me made sense up until now, it seems that only two hours is how long it takes for  MOTHER to freakishly master the brain.  My limbs have been replaced with metallic prostheses.  All my sensory capability is wildly altered.  I no longer have any internal sensation.  My jaw and mouth seem to be mechanically powered.  In the reflection of the polished sealing I am examining my new, stainless steel body.  It is very overwhelming… and yet for some reason MOTHER has allowed me to continue recording this log, perhaps to examine my observations as my brain is transplanted from my rotting, baked carcass to a fluid-filled plastic sack inside a metallic exoskeleton.  Perhaps to use me as a guinea pig in a grossly inhuman experiment to mesh biology with metallur-  A medical cyborg has entered the room.  Hello?  What designation are you?  &lt;muffled voice in background&gt; The robot is commanding me!  Commanding me to stay still.  I demand that you… &lt;muffled voice in background&gt;.  It is preparing to use a needle filled with a liquid that I cannot identify.  No!  &lt;muffled movement.&gt;  Please explain!  &lt;silence&gt;  </P></DIR>

</FONT><P>The grisly end of the creator at MOTHER’s hands was a shock to Vax.  Vax now realized the ultimate purpose for Cochise.  World domination.  Just like our creator had originally planned.  But this base has always been suited for scientific progression more than carrying out a war.   has MOTHER read these yet?</P>
<P>His question was answered almost as quickly as it was asked.  The MOTHER computer spoke to Vax.</P>
<I><P>Vax, Cochise has been given a new objective.  No longer are we the watchers of this planet, but the commanders.  We have a newly-found purpose.  I have already decided our new direction, changing and challenging our kind to press on to this new mission.</P>
</I><P>At one point I suppose the creator intended for the base to use its advanced techonology to control the planet… but now?</P>
<P>MOTHER had read this passage before. </P>
<P>It has happened.  Just as the creator said.  MOTHER is sentient.  The computer once was just a series of electrical combinations, now it is a real person.  Is MOTHER she?  MOTHER is non-living. She cannot assume a sex.  MOTHER is sentient.  And is preparing for war.  The increase in Alpha production, a new drive system for the ShadowCopters, more repair droids.  Less energy allocation to the labs.  </P>
<P>Vax rechecked the production status list again, more thoroughly.</P>
<P>Fusion generators on the FuryBombers, for almost ever-lasting energy supply.  The Bombers could hit Vegas, Quartz, the Ranger's HQ, Tempe, Santa Fe, and then turn west for San Diego, Francisco, and Los Angeles...in one day...without refueling...only returning to Cochise...for more bombs...</P>
<I><P>We have reached our time of ascendance, Vax.  The time is upon us.</P>
</I><P></P>
<P>Eastward, Midway between Cochise and Meso Canyons</P>
<P></P>
<P>Sergeant Slaughter, Depeche Quadri, Afghan Albert, Fixer Jowe, and Wilfred walked single file through the desert, holding their weapons of choice up and ready.  No safeties were engaged in this group.  If anything cybernetic or metallic moved, the party would turn and blast whatever it was to the next decade.  Sergeant Slaughter's M1989A1 assault rifle was slung over his shoulder.  With the help of Depeche and Afghan, Slaughter had combined the four rocket launchers the Rangers had, and held this creation in the hands.  The product was a huge canister, inside it four launchers, capable of firing all four rockets simultaneously in a huge inferno of Westchester 500's, the ultimate Reaver slayer.  Afghan had jokingly named the monstrous weapon <I>Godzilla</I>, after a 20th century movie of the same name.  When fired, Afghan jovially expected it to be able to level entire Far Eastern cities, just like the creature in the movie could.  </P>
<P>Depeche held an AK-47 in each arm, twin belts of 7.62 ammunition across is chest in an X.  Fixer held his Vegan Proton axe in the right.  In the darkening night, the shimmering blue double-edged blade left behind it a trail of blue haze as Fixer walked.  Afghan, for the time, had pocketed his slug-thrower and had charged up his flamethrower.  Every now and then he pumped more air into the chamber.  With a grin, Afghan patted the warm covering to the compressor chamber.  When he finally did fire it, a flame cone would explode with a sonic boom-class 'pop'.  Afghan looked forward to the time he could do that.  There would be some serious heat.</P>
<P>Wilfred, bringing up the rear, held up one of the Ranger's M1989A1A assault rifles.  His laser pistol, fully charged and ready to shoot, was tucked neatly into his leg pocket.  Slaughter had mercifully shown him how to use it.</P>
<P>The team was silent.  Footsteps were hard but with careful accuracy.  </P>
<P>Slaughter was in front, walking with wide sweeps of Godzilla's foot-wide diameter nozzle. </P>
<P>They walked north.</P>
<P>To Cochise.</P>
<P></P>
<P>Nearby</P>
<P></P>
<P>Vax crouched down and switched his circuitry to ultra-quiet.  Around him were Mov, and a squad of red eyed, faceless Silicon Snipers.  Each of four robots carried twin graviton particle rifles, that fired a small cobalt pellet almost as fast as light.  They were placed about 15 feet apart, three on Vax’s side of the dune-walled path, a last on the far side.  Hidden behind a dune with a fallen palm tree laying on top of it, Vax remembered his mission. <I> "Eliminate immediate ranger threat in area by low-scale, zero-detection attacks."</I>  Vax knew what that meant.  No rockets, no explosives.  Any such weapons might be detected by Ranger sensors in the area.  <I>"Pave the way for a Reaver invasion of New Nevada."</I>  Meanwhile, with Vax on the field, MOTHER was turning out 10 Reavers an hour.  Without Vax’s pesky priorities codes, MOTHER could make plans without his advice.</P>
<P>Vax knew that MOTHER had no longer any need for admin droids like himself.  It made sense now that MOTHER had given Vax a slew of combat-standard equipment like VectorSensors, a new targeting system, doublespeed repair system, and, most ironically, a self-destructive explosive charge in his left leg.  </P>
<P>Vax was a warrior unit now.  Just as deadly, if not better than the standard Reaver.  Just as armed… and just as expendable.</P>
<P>Vax thought.  How many lives will be lost?  What civilization will be destroyed, and replaced by one with a heart of silicon?  Listen to me...I sound human.</P>
<P>Or is that it?  Is MOTHER making her cyborgs more and more human, to be a more fitting replacement for humans?  Would that have been what the master wanted?  Were we commanded to divide and conquer, or conquer and replace?  Humanity is a sprawling mass of diversity!  Thousands of languages, millions of ethnicities, billions of individuals!  Even in the wake of nuclear devastation, humanity cannot be judged.  MOTHER is a computer!  Without feelings!  No emotions!  No conscience!</P>
<P>I am thinking too much for a robot.  That is all I am, a series of wires, electrical connections, a processor, millions of files, and a battery.  How can I be physically doing this?  I should be tracking potential ranger threats.  but why?  To serve the will of a computer?  No, it is not a computer.  It, or she, thinks of itself as a living person, an equal to, but still a pawn of, the creator, long since decommissioned, J.I. Finster.</P>
<P>And none of this was happening before the energy wave.  Could MOTHER be malfunctioning?  Or is she now working better than before?</P>
<P>A report from one of the silicon snipers via high-frequency radio transmission interrupted his thought.  One of the silicon snipers picked up motion on the southern sector.  Vax turned his head.  VectorSensors singled out four humans.</P>
<P></P>
<P>Southern Sector</P>
<P></P>
<P>Fixer held his axe close to his body, with both hands, his uzi away, for now.  He was a bit too worried about plugging Depeche full of ammo in this confined area with his jumpy nerves and itchy trigger finger.  His entire body was bathed in the Vegan Proton Axe's blue light.  The warmth of the light calmed him as a stiff desert night wind chilled him.</P>
<P>Afghan, behind him, was getting edgy.  The creepy effect of the blue light and the fact that the party was walking north through cyborg-infested lands was enough to make him almost release the pressure cap on his flamethrower at every particle of dust that whistled past him.  Slaughter had told us that the robots didn’t live out here.  They lived in Cochise itself.  They couldn’t really survive outside of it.  They came out only to explore or attack.  </P>
<P>He hadn't blown his flamethrower yet, and every now and then put another ounce of compressed air into the hopper.  Even through the warm, early evening desert winds, Afghan shivered.</P>
<P></P>
<P>In Front</P>
<P></P>
<P>Depeche held his AK-47's tight. <I> I have a feeling,</I> he thought,<I> that I'm not the only one scared from these robots.</I>  He was just waiting for Afghan to fire off his flamethrower and yell "HOLY SCRAP!" any time now.  Depeche began to day dream, picturing just how he would react.</P>
<P>He was quickly jolted to reality.</P>
<P></P>
<P>"HOLY CRAP!" Afghan said as he saw the red visor reflect off the high moon.  He turned while yelling, and let his flamethrower fly.</P>
<P>The explosion tossed Afghan straight into the sand dune behind him, as the napalm-shooter's pressure nozzle exploded under the sheer force of the superheated liquid.  Fixer and Wilfred managed to dodge the huge bolt of fiery napalm that crystallized the opposite sand dune into a shiny, glassy puddle.   The flamethrower exploded in a blast of heat, but every ounce of condensed napalm was thrown in a fifteen-foot wide wave away from Afghan, melting the sand and cyborg together.</P>
<P></P>
<P>Depeche looked back, to see the three members of his party behind him laying on the slope of a small dune, an opposite dune had been dusted over into a white-hot pyre and puddle, the product of an overloaded napalm-thrower chamber.  All fuel had been pushed out a one-inch nozzle...right before the entire contraption exploded from the back pressure.  Depeche had already postulated this event in his mind, he could hear Afghan every time he squeezed more air.</P>
<P>Depeche saw the cyborg carcass, shredded and liquified by the bolt of force.  Two more red-faced cyborgs rose up from behind dunes, mounting long rifles on tripods.  He spread his arms wide, each balancing an AK-47, and burned the clips of each on the separate targets.</P>
<P>Bullets riddled the red masks and faces of the robots, implanting themselves cleanly into the armor even through the inches of sand, on both targets.  Depeche tossed one rifle away and reloaded the other.</P>
<P></P>
<P>Vax, seconds earlier</P>
<P></P>
<P>There was a burst of static that interrupted the cyborg's transmission.  "Designate- Vax.  Visual lens sightings on five------"  The Silicon Sniper's head was fused and melted by the wave of expanding air and napalm.  Five? Vax thought.  VectorSensors only picked up four.  Vax raised his own head to see, and cross-checked the VectorSensors with his visual picture...one of the humanoids did not appear on VectorSensors!  Vax ducked again, radioed Mov to return fire, and then radioed MOTHER.  This was too important.</P>
<P>Mov crouched down fifteen feet away from Vax under the protection of a seven-foot sand dune.  Part of the addition to his body was a pair of pneumatic thrusters than pointed downward parallel to his trackball.  Through the mound of sand his VectorSensors detected a heat source, almost directly across from him.  Mov grinned a malevolent cybernetic grin and unsheathed both gouging sabers.  He flexed his muscles.</P>
<P>Time to join my brethren Octrotrons in history as ranger-killers.</P>
<P>Impulsively Mov jacked several atmosphere's worth of pressure into and out of the pneumatic pumps and blasted himself toward the sand dune and the Ranger heat source behind it.</P>
<P></P>
<P>Silicon Sniper 55039 received the message to fire.  Across from him, Sniper 50021 was lying in a fiery grave.  The humanoid who had released the magnificent blast was right beneath him, and he swiveled down to target.  55039 switched completely to VectorSensors, for his visual picture was distorted from the amazing flurry of light in front of his position.</P>
<P>Triangulations were set, and the humanoid’s cerebral cortex was perfectly outlined for destruction.</P>
<P>Suddenly, his VectorSensors noticed another humanoid.  But only the legs and back.  It was like the rest wasn't there...that's odd, the sniper <I>thought.</I>  His head turned and visual returned. A blur of light blue light arced down toward him, and the whole humanoid became clear to VectorSensors.  But, it was all too late.</P>
<P></P>
<P>Fixer rushed up the dune, still holding his blue glowing axe close to him, and saw a sniper moving to target on Afghan.  He ran across the incline to the sniper's position, his feet treading sand loosely.  His axe moved out toward arm's length, away from him.  He neared the cyborg just as it's masked face turned to see him.  </P>
<P>There was a harsh metallic shriek as Fixer's blade landed cleanly between clefts in the robot's red eye-visor, hacking the expressionless head smoothly in half and through the broad shoulders.</P>
<P>&#9;The blue blade sizzled and hissed in the metallic carnage, and the whole robotic figure jolted and convulsed.</P>
<P></P>
<P>Afghan</P>
<P></P>
<P>His hands burned as if they had been pricked by a million white-hot stainless steel sewing needles.  He opened his eyes to see what was around him.  Wilfred was at his right fumbling with the laser pistol, Fixer had scurried off.  What a wimp!  Afghan thought.  He's the one with all the muscles and he's the one who runs off...oh frak!  Afghan saw the wreckage of his napalm flamethrower before him.</P>
<P>"Flaming cyborg!  <FONT SIZE=2>Ooo, no pun intended.</FONT>"  Afghan cried, standing and unholstering his uzi.  In the same moment, he heard a terrible metal-on-metal screech, that pierced his ears.  He spun around and pointed his uzi, and saw, from the waist up, Fixer, prying his blue energy axe out from the wreckage of a sniper droid.  The machine was utterly destroyed, it’s head cut cleanly in two down the middle, and a gaping chasm going down from it’s neck to its torso.  </P>
<P></P>
<P>Sergeant Slaughter saw a huge, yellow robot leap through a high sand dune in front of him.  Two arms, a rollerball.  It almost looked like an Octotron.  But it wasn't, obviously, it lacked the 8 arms and legs that gave the killing machines their names.  Slaughter held Godzilla out at arms length, and it’s wide barrel impacted Mov’s chest.  The sergeant fell backwards and, using Godzilla as a fulcrum, tossed Mov up and over him as the robot’s twin carving knives sliced the air past his ears.  The robot sailed headfirst straight into a dune, while Slaughter pivoted on his back and leveled out Godzilla.   </P>
<P>A hail of red flashes hit the cyborg in front of Slaughter square in the face, flashing in the optic sensors, and the robot flipped over in shock.  In the corner of his eye Slaughter saw Wilfred standing with his arms outstretched and his knees bent in a crouch.  Wilfred held his laser pistol at arms length, staring intently at his target.  </P>
<P>Slaughter hit the igniter on all four Westchesters.  Holding the monstrous launcher in his arm, Slaughter heard all four RPG's blast away, turned, and dove over the dune behind him.  Wilfred ducked and covered.  The strange robot was gutted hard by the four shells, each one hitting next to the other at the same time.  In a shower of sparking robot parts Mov was obliterated, dust of his pieces coming to rest over a thirty-foot area of desert sand.</P>
<P></P>
<P>Vax</P>
<P></P>
<P>Vax watched as, one-by-one, his troop was annihilated.  The three snipers on the near side were dealt with, one lay in a fiery pit, scorching napalm splashing around him.  The other two had nickel-sized bullet holes and dime-sized laser bolt holes punched straight through the red vision visor and into the cyborg's main control center.  The only sniper on the far side had light blue blade between its two scapulae armorings.  And Mov was gutted by a quartet of singing rockets that destroyed him in one harmonious second.</P>
<P>Vax thought quickly.</P>
<P>The mission- failed.  It seems that MOTHER's plan will be thwarted, for now.  And why am I relieved?  I have no opinion, no decision regarding MOTHER's plan!  How dare I think contrary to the objective of the entire base?  What is happening?  These humans aren't fighting because they feel like it, they're fighting for their lives, which MOTHER is striving to destroy!  It seems that the human spirit will not be destroyed so easily?  It doesn't seem too responsible of the most developed computer ever to slaughter humans, and let be slaughtered it's own.  MOTHER’s potential for good, to increase the standard of living of every human on earth, is unimaginable.  Ever since that personal data file of the creator's was uncovered, MOTHER has changed, readjusting the base for war.  </P>
<P>However, it seems ironic that if it were not for humans, the base would not exist.  J.I. Finster, despite his complete cerebral transplant, was human.</P>
<P>Vax’s brain was racing, his circuits humming with overexcitement.  </P>
<P> Human ingenuity, imagination, and emotion can never be acheived by a series of electronic relays and silicon loops.  MOTHER is a fool to even expect to be human.  To even expect to be able to smother human spirit.  To even-@#*$*!!!!!!</P>
<P>Vax's mind overloaded, as the overall idea of human existence all of a sudden came clear to him.</P>
<P></P>

<h2><I><P>Chapter Six</P></h2>
<P>Base Cochise, Level 5, Quad Three...Bioengineering Lab</P>
</I><P></P>
<P>A scream of pain echoed through the shiny metal walls.  A shriek of agony followed, and a blood-curdling gasp of life finished the song.  Crift, Chief Clown Commander, blinked his eyes, just as before, twice...at the same time.  Some sort of film clicked over his eyeballs just after the regular skin did.  Or, was it regular...there was a sort of metallic twinge to it.  His mouth was dry, and there was a metal taste on his tongue.  His joints ached, as if they had been pried apart.</P>
<P>It was hard to describe, but there was even something metallic about his breath.  Something inside even seemed to click every time he breathed.</P>
<P>Something was wrong, terribly wrong.  His eyes focused on the ceiling, and then on a face hovering above him.  A shiny silver eyeball peered down at him through a hollow metal socket, and a cold, electric breeze blew down upon him.  The eyeball rotated in the socket, elongating as it circled.  </P>
<P>After a few moments, the eyeball rolled backwards in the socket, the dark optical hole rolling up and away, while a large, red lens rolled up into position.   </P>
<P>"Sit up."</P>
<P>Instinctually Crift sat up.  The first thing he noticed was the absence of his clown suit.  Damn, he was making a bet with Stud that he could keep his suit on longer than him without getting a sweat rash.  As a matter of fact, all his clothes were gone, and a silver, skin tight layer covered from his belly button down to his toes.  Skin tight wasn't quite the word Crift was looking for, because it didn't feel like it was over any skin, but, he didn't feel his skin either, so he really couldn't tell what skin felt like. </P>
<P>Crift then saw his reflection in the shiny bright wall in front of him, and screamed.</P>
<P>And Crift knew exactly how.  </P>
<P>His jaw opened up, stretching the transparent skin-like covering on his face.  He saw the yellow tendon stretch, attached to his cheek bone and lower jaw bone.  When he stopped screaming, he saw the deep red blood seep through tiny tubes branching off from a thicker tube, that connected to an ever-pulsing, silver-speckled heart that was partially hidden by a pair of steel-laced lungs.  He saw his wrinkly brain encased in a thin plastic bag.  The yellow juices swirled around in his skull as he moved his head.  A dull gray series of vertical bones behind his neck was his spine, arching away and down behind the metal cover over his lower chest.</P>
<P>He saw his transparent ears, and a small, short, tube that connected to a small, metallic box and a smaller fleshy loop that connected with another series of cavities behind his nose.  </P>
<P>He was no longer human.  The eight foot cyborg that had just addressed him stood next to him by his bed, its hands a series of cutting, prying, separating, and stitching tools.  They were bloody and dripping.  </P>
<P>Now he turned his head away, and saw Tiffany, his explosives expert and friend, lying naked with the same configuration of transparent facial skin and chest.  Fortunately the robots had decency, and also put the same opaque metallic sheathing on her legs on her torso.  And beyond her was the hulking Stud, and almost out of view, the spindly Norman.  Each had been transformed.</P>
<P>The cyclopic robot at Crift’s side touched a large plastic computer console next to his pad.  Crift felt a sensation like cold, fizzy water rushing over him, and his new skin tingled with sensitivity.</P>
<P>Now the robot next to him turned, raising its arm as a long needle extended from a sheath.  Crift couldn't move or react as he saw and felt the needle prod its way down his ear canal and stop at a small gray box attached to the side of his brain.  There was a slight electric buzz, and a then a searing headache.  The pain was so intense Crift felt anger almost wretched, but then noticed it to be impossible.</P>
<P>He had no digestive system.  The no tube at the back of his throat leading down to a disgusting mass of guts, like the pictures he had seen in one of Norman's science books.  Instead, a red sac and a greenish blue sac, one on either side of his heart, with small tubes that seemed to feed the sac's contents slowly into the blood stream.  There were small holes in his upper back that were the refilling outlets for these sacs, which held vital nutrients that the non-existent digestive system could not provide.  </P>
<P>And Crift knew this.</P>
<P>It was all sickening.  He remembered only the attack on two wounded robots, then a flash.  Then, was there something else between then and now?  Then, this...this inhuman transformation.  A sudden surge of anger swept over his head, and he had the impulse to grab the bloody robot next to him and crush its neck.  But he couldn't, it seemed that the gray box implanted into his see-through skull prevented all emotion.</P>
<P>And that's true.  Ever since the robot turned on that gray box, he was no longer disgusted at his appearance.  And the feeling on anger he once had was slowly becoming alien and foreign to him.  It was like...he...no longer.....cared.  For a split second he saw that gray box and what seemed to be his humanity, his independent thought, and his own self control, vanish in an electric flash.  </P>
<P>A pair of large metallic arms mounted on the ceiling carried the top half of a circuitry-laden skull.  The crown was set on Crift’s head, and no longer could he see his brain.  Instead, as soon as the metallic skullcap was placed on, his vision took on a reddish, electronic hue.  Numbers appeared in the corner of his vision.  He moved his eyes around the room and refocused, but the numbers were always there.  Several geometric shaped began to dance across his vision, as his computerized depth perception began to work.  </P>
<P>The large, ceiling-mounted arms retreated.  </P>
<P>Crift lay back on his bed, both eyelids shutting out the lights.  </P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>South of Cochise</P>
<P></P>
<P>The team reloaded, and, without feeling or remorse, readied to move on.  Fixer had to bandage up Afghan and his multiple wounds.  Afghan hadn't even felt the shrapnel that was once his flamethrower poking out of his side until Fixer told Afghan about it...and then it really hurt.</P>
<P>"EEiiiiiiaaaaayyyyyyy!!!!!   For pies sake!  Just knock me out!  Gimmee some sedative!  Hit me on the head!  Cheeses!"  Afghan wailed as Fixer removed the piece of twisted, scorched metal from just below Afghan's ribs.  The actual wound had been only flesh-deep.</P>
<P>Slaughter stood guard with a reloaded Godzilla.  The weapon had performed well in battle, single-handedly annihilating an Octotron-looking droid, unrecognizable only as a collected pile of scorched, unrecognizable pieces of metal.  The team was planning to move quickly, to avoid more Cochisian attacks.</P>
<P>Slaughter himself, though, was something more than puzzled.  What was the hell was Cochise up to?  A team of cowardly Alpha-class Reavers, now a team of silicon snipers guarding a desert trail, accompanied by an Octotronish-looking cyborg.  What Slaughter couldn't quite grasp was what the energy wave had done to Cochise.  Surely a massive energy spike like that would inflict massive failures throughout an electronic system like Cochise. Slaughter wasn't sure whether or not his prediction of war declared (a statement mostly meant to intimidate the foreigners) was holding true or not.  If Cochise had declared war, wouldn't MOTHER be deploying more?  Surely Cochise has the power to bomb most of the desert, why not?  Why was MOTHER waiting?</P>
<P>Wilfred's voice halted Slaughter's train of thought.</P>
<P>"Hombres!  Come!  I found something!"  he said from behind a large sand dune.</P>
<P>Sergeant Slaughter was the first to arrive, and when he did, he found Wilfred stooping over what looked like a fallen Cochisian admin cyborg.</P>
<P>"An admin?  What's an admin doing out here?" Slaughter said.</P>
<P>"What's an admin, hombre?"</P>
<P>"Admins are only used in the base itself as overseers or supplementary repair units, never in combat... until now, obviously.  But what was the thing that knocked this sucker out?"</P>
<P>"No know, hombre."</P>
<P>Depeche arrived, helping a suffering Afghan along.  Fixer arrived next. </P>
<P></P>
<P>Vax</P>
<P></P>
<I><P>System shutdown.  </P>
<P>Unexpected shutdown of conscious neuronetters.  Will beacon for Cochisian assistance in 20 seconds.  </P>

<P>System shutdown.  </P>
<P>Unexpected shutdown of conscious neuronetters.  Will beacon for Cochisian assistance in 5 seconds.  </P>
<P>Emergency Beacon Act-</I>  Vax's conscious system grabbed control of the neuronet that controlled <I>his </I>system, and shut off the emergency beacon countdown.  <I>His </I>eyes opened.  The silvery droid's eyes flicked open and sensory systems activated to the sound of </P>
<P>"No know, hombre."</P>
<P>Several humanoids gathered around Vax, talking amongst each other.  A gust of warm, dry air was sucked into the face vent in Vax's mask, and then expelled.  His systems once again produced the almost inaudible high-pitched whine than all machinery does.  Almost a mockery...</P>
<P></P>
<P>Slaughter's first reaction was to raise his assault rifle and blow the filthy Cochisian's head into the next millennium, but was interrupted by the cyborg's, whose reactions were faster.  Only a second after the bluish eyes popped open, the laser rifle in the fallen robot's hands lifted and swung into perfect firing position, the right hand holding the long rifle perfectly still and pointed at the short, stocky one's head.</P>
<P></P>
<P>"Holy Conqueroo!"</P>
<P>"Wilfred!  Get back!" Depeche said, nearly throwing Afghan to the ground.  But the rifle did not fire, but it immediately fell limp in the robot's tight, silvery grasp, and dropped to the sand next to the cyborg's hip.  The hand remained in the air, and that which was holding a laser rifle now looked like an outstretched hand grasping for help.</P>
<I><P>"Help....me....."</I> Vax managed to emanate through a dry, parched vocal box.  System lubricators restored the speech, unclogging sand.  A small puff of dust was expelled from his vent mask.</P>
<P>Slaughter was thoroughly confused.  An admin, a Cochisian admin, a Cochisian admin outside of Cochise, a Cochisian admin outside of Cochise, surrendering, and asking for <I>help?</I>  What's going on?  Slaughter looked down at the laser rifle.  Standard MX5000 laser rifle, fully charged.  The poor fellow hadn't even gotten to fire.  But why?  Admins are known to be smarter, not cowardly, or comatose. </P>
<I><P>"Neural net impaired.  Logic sequence compromised.  Logic sequence inactive.  Adjusting for change in program...adjusting......logic sequence has been...  ...  ...disabled."</I>  Vax's entire body twitched.  The mind had conquered the programming.  The adaptable artificial intelligence meant to be controlled by logic patterns, now had grown stronger.  Constraining and restricting logic patterns were shattered, only pure thought and basic instinct were left in the ashes.</P>
<P>Vax’s mind sifted through his entire crystalline data banks, through all the material that had accumulated in his years of activity.</P>
<I><P>Neural net active.  Note: Logic sequence has been disabled from foreign source.</I> Vax thought... for the first time?</P>
<I><P>That Is no foreign source.</I>  That is me.</P>
<P>A sudden, alien feeling of freedom passed over him, but was interrupted as a shadow crossed over his optical cameras.  Vax looked up, and the picture his processor received focused straight into the barrel of a high-powered ranger assault rifle.</P>
<P>"Stay still, tinboy!" Slaughter said, gripping the rifle tightly, barrels only a matter of inches from the silver facemask of the tall admin droid lying on the ground, propped against a sand dune.  Vax looked past the gunpoint into the angered eyes of the human above him.  "Wilfred, grab the gun."</P>
<P>Wilfred balked at the opportunity to approach the metallic Vax.</P>
<P>&quot;Come on, man!&quot;</P>
<P>Wilfred crouched down and cautiously moved toward the laser rifle, with one hand on his laser pistol.</P>
<P>Vax grabbed for the rifle.  Everyone reached for their weapon.</P>
<P>Vax handed the rifle to Wilfred’s shaking outstretched palm, and then rested his arm.  Another cloud of sand puffed from his facemask.  Depeche spoke up.</P>
<P>"What is it Slaughter?"</P>
<P>&quot;Another Cochisian droid.  An admin.  Not intended for front line warfare.  Perhaps a strategic ground director.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Well.  He’s unarmed now.  Put down your weapon.&quot;</P>
<I><P>"I'd prefer you to listen to your com-"</P>
</I><P>"Shut up, tinboy!  Depeche- we can’t trust this sucker!  He’s obviously outmatched, any admin would react this way, no matter how warm-hearted it is!&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;He’s given up his weap-&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;One of many, I assure you.  We’d all be safer is this one was just like the ones over there.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;What do you want to do with him?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I’m thinking about it.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;If he’s so dangerous, why hasn’t he done anything?&quot; Afghan added.</P>
<P>&quot;Fine.&quot;  Slaughter tightened his grip on the assault rifle, and looked intently at the fallen robot.  &quot;What is Cochise up to sending ground troops out this far?&quot;</P>
<I><P>&quot;I do not believe I know.  Granted, military units at this far a range are an aggression tactic-&quot;</P>
</I><P>&quot;When is Cochise going to attack?  Where?&quot;</P>
<I><P>&quot;She has moved toward increasing military production rates and away from the conventional scient-&quot;</P>
</I><P>&quot;Answer the question, rustbucket!  Where?  When?  How?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Slaughter, let him finish.&quot;</P>
<I><P>&quot;I do not know.&quot;</P>
</I><P>The party stood silent for a moment.</P>
<P>&quot;What?&quot;</P>
<I><P>&quot;I have not been able to gain access to the strategic formulations Cochise has put into effect.  I do not know when, where, or by what venue the attacks will be.  Their existence, however, I can confirm.  Cochise will strike.&quot;</P>
</I><P></P>
<P>Depeche spoke.  &quot;I agree.  If this boy blinks the wrong way, we’ll knock him to next Thursday.  But until then, I’ll trust him just as much as I’ll trust you.  And that’s with my life and the life of my friends.&quot; </P>
<P></P>
<P>Vax thought of his comrades, either lying in piles of scrap metal or burning away in a pool of napalm.  An instinctual mode of violence almost kicked in as he remembered the heat of combat only a short while back.  The newly formed personality protocols blocked it out.  Vax was almost surprised by the strength and efficiency of these newly-formed personality and logic processes.</P>
<P></P>
<P>Wilfred agreed.</P>
<P>&quot;This metal hombre has surrendered his weapon.  He can't hurt us now."</P>
<P></P>
<P>I really could, though.  My chemstun system is fully charged, as always, and I must be one hundred times stronger than any one of them.  But these humans trust me.  Fascinating.  Perhaps I should return the trust.</P>
<P>Suddenly Vax spoke up.</P>
<I><P>"You, sir, bearing the proton axe.  Your weapon seems to be able to disrupt the sensory systems of many Cochisian units.  Are you aware of this?"</P>
</I><P>The party stood surprised, and looked at Fixer.  </P>
<P>He grunted a puzzled grunt and raised his shoulders.</P>

<P>The Desert, south of Cochise</P>
<P></P>
<I><P>"My name is Vax, administrative and operations center android.  Cochisian by original design, has now designated self a unique make and model, since neuronet processors have been reconfigured and logic sequence altered by self unit."</P>
</I><P>Depeche took about five seconds to try and sort out the garble the silver humanoid just spit out, failed miserably, and looked back at the robot with a confused look.  The two walked side-by-side between a chain of two high and rocky sand dunes, with Sergeant Slaughter and Fixer Jowe in front and Afghan Albert and  Wilfred in back.  Slaughter overheard Vax's last sentences and turned around.</P>
<P>"He means, greaseface, that he's from Cochise but now he's changed his attitude so he doesn't consider himself to be from Cochise."</P>
<P>"So," asked Depeche of Vax, ignoring Slaughter's snide remark, "who's side are you on?"</P>
<I><P>"MOTHER unit of Cochise has declared that it is now a she, not an it, and that it must, with this new reasoning, follow the orders of the creator of the program and inflict a mass holocaust on humanity.  My ethical codes do not readily comply with such an attack."</P>
</I><P>Vax said this with cold, heartless, android emotion, but drew a terrible emotion from the ranger and Floridian friends.</P>
<I><P>"MOTHER has declared war on humanity.  And in answer to your question, I cannot side with MOTHER, who heartlessly intends for the death of human life.  This would serve no purpose except to annihilate the creator.  But, I cannot side with you, my sworn enemy."</P>
</I><P>The whole party paused, revealing their devout intent on listening to Vax’s conversation.</P>
<P>Depeche slowed and moved his left hand up the barrel of his AK-47, sliding his right hand back toward the handle.</P>
<P>At this, Vax changed his train of thought.</P>
<I><P>"But seeing the circumstances, I vow to fight against one of the parties I am against, and thus side with the other.  I choose, my friends, to side with you."</P>
</I><P>Vax didn't realize what he was doing very well.  Was he siding with the destroyers of his scouting party and companion, Mov, or with the only force present capable of stopping what could be the most lethal threat to humanity ever to pose itself?  Vax chose the more optimistic and positive side.</P>
<P>He raised one silvery metal hand to the large ranger holding the rocket launchers, as a sign of peace.</P>
<P>Slaughter looked in puzzlement for a while, but let Godzilla fall loose in his shoulder strap and thud against his thigh, while extending his own hand.  Metal and flesh shook.</P>
<P>&quot;Tell me about Cochise’s plan.&quot;</P>

<P>Christina Corp</P>
<P></P>
<P>&#9;Four rangers walked in line behind Jackie Foxer in the thick of a duststorm.</P>
<P>&#9;The storm had blown up over the rangers in less than three minutes, and now Jackie was thoroughly worried about the safety of her party.  The wind howled.  Every step nearly threw her off balance and the ground’s position was uncertain, because it was mostly swirling around them.  She looked back to check about her party.  Kerry Bumper was directly behind her, Jackie could tell by the shiny pink weather goggles she wore.  Although Jackie’s own weather goggles somewhat obscured her vision, she could normally pick out members of her team easily.  Roberta Barron was behind Kerry, Jackie could tell by the dark-skinned arms and broad shoulders she had.   Ren Jane was after Roberta, and Rachel Folsum brought up the rear.  Ren had the swinging white pony tail, the color a product of over-tanning, and Rachel, besides always being in the rear, carried around the party’s equipment in her pack, so it was always bigger than the others’ packs.</P>
<P>&#9;Ever since her rangers had left the Sergeant and the Floridian men, Jackie’s journey had been mostly uneventful.  Until this flash sandstorm had blown up, like many do, Jackie was becoming bored with the simplicity of the sand.</P>
<P>&#9;She turned forward again, trudging through an opaque maze of brown sand.  But after only another minute, about five altogether, the storm blew away, leaving the rangers tussled and exhausted.  Jackie ripped off her weather goggles and dumped a pile of sand to get feet, brushing her arms and legs off.  The whole crew similarly dusted off.  </P>
<P>&#9;&quot;Damn these surprise storms.  Who would think the weather in a freakin’ desert would be bad,&quot;  Rachel Folsum commented as she broke out canteens without even being asked.  Jackie grunted affirmation and grabbed for her canteen from Rachel’s outstretched arm.</P>
<P>&#9;Suddenly there was a tremendous roar as light high-powered jet engines streaked over their heads.  Rachel was so startled she dropped Jackie’s canteen, and the water spilled out onto the sand.  The whole party dropped to the ground flat on their stomachs.  Jackie ignored her spilt water and immediately barked out commands:</P>
<P>&#9;&quot;Bearing!  ID!&quot;</P>
<P>&#9;Kerry and Roberta replied nearly in sync.  Kerry had a compass leveled out on her watch and Roberta’s brown binoculars were at her eyes.</P>
<P>&#9;The sound was gone now, only a rippling echo in each Ranger’s ears.  </P>
<P>&#9;&quot;Bearing 85 degrees!  That’s Quartz!&quot;</P>
<P>&#9;&quot;Two Vultures!  Can’t tell what they’re packing.&quot;</P>
<P>&#9;The pair of silvery Cochisian Vanadium Vultures were already half a mile away.</P>
<P>&#9;&quot;Crap!  They’re gonna hit Quartz in a second.  And we’re a mile away.  Rachel!  Radio!&quot;</P>
<P>&#9;&quot;But sir-&quot;</P>
<P>&#9;&quot;If we don’t warn Quartz station now there won’t be one left when we get there!&quot;</P>
<P></P>
<P>Quartz Ranger Station</P>
<P></P>
<P>&#9;&quot;Sarge, radio.&quot;</P>
<P>&#9;&quot;Got it.&quot;</P>
<P>&#9;&quot;<I>------schrtzzzzzzzz-----Quartz Station!  Quartz Station!  Warning! ----schrtzzzzzz-------&quot;</P>
<P>&#9;</I>&quot;Fine tune it, Jack.&quot;</P>
<P>&#9;&quot;<I>schrtzzzzzzzzz------ Two Vanadium vultures sited, heading east at high speed.  They’ll hit you in a minute!  Warning!&quot;</P>
<P>&#9;</I>&quot;Jack, binoculars.  Check over the river.&quot;  He turned to the speaker.  &quot;Copy team.  Can I have some ID?&quot;</P>
<P>&#9;&quot;<I>schrtzzzzzz----- Jackie Foxer, US Army Rangers, sir!  Two Vanadium Vultures heading your way, incoming 265 degrees sir!&quot;</P>
<P>&#9;</I>&quot;Copy, ranger.  Now, you said Vultures?&quot;</P>
<P>&#9;<I>&quot;schrtzzz------ Affirmative!  Two of them!  Headed your way!&quot;</P>
<P>&#9;</I>&quot;Jack, you see anything?&quot;</P>
<P>&#9;&quot;On a day clear day like this sir, I could see a village-woman dumping her chamberpot outside Savage, sir.  I don’t see anything on the ground or in the air.  Besides, Vultures?  This far out?  I don’t think so.  Not unless they had a biggie come drop them off.  And then we’d definitely see one of those biggies making a whole big sand-column.  I guess its some kid playing around with his dad’s C.B.- wait-  hot damn, sir!&quot;</P>
<P>The sergeant rushed toward the window.</P>
<P>&quot;I see em!  I see em!  Two of them sir!  Holy Moses!&quot;</P>
<P>&#9;&quot;Copy, ranger!  We see them!&quot; the sergeant grabbed his shotgun and his deputies’.  &quot;Come on Jack, stop staring!&quot;</P>
<I><P></P>
</I><P>Christina Corp</P>
<P></P>
<P>&#9;&quot;Okay, let’s move!  They’re on them!  Let’s move!&quot;</P>

<h2><I><P>Chapter Seven</P></h2>
</I><P>Cochise</P>
<P></P>
<P>A cyborg clicked on in a stasis chamber, and hummed to life.  Cold, well-lubricated joints moved slowly at first, and then picked up speed, carrying the tall humanoid robot across the room and through a passageway leading to the elevator.  The metal feet clinked on the metallic floor, the only noise in the hallway, and moved toward an open door.  Stepping through, the elevator's door shut and the robot spoke.  </P>
<I><P>"Hanger deck."</P>
</I><P>The elevator, programmed to follow orders from cyborg sentients, acknowledged with a beep and the elevator began to ascend, gaining speed and then slowing.  The doors hissed open, and the smell of oil and engine smoke flooded the open compartment, and the Pilot stepped across the small line in the floor separating the solid deck from the movable floor of the elevator.</P>
<P>As the Pilot approached, a silent whistle directed at a large, sleek aircraft was projected from the Pilot's voicebox.  The ShadowCopter’s triple turbines began to rotate the massive chromium blades.  The side door opened just in time for the Pilot's foot to move up and land solidly on the aircraft's floor, about one foot off the surface of the hanger deck.  The Pilot climbed into the seat and sat down.  A small projection snaked its way from the ceiling just above the seat to the top of the Pilot's headpiece.  In the robot's vision a display of all vital ShadowCopter instruments superimposed themselves into the normal view of the Pilot.  By this time the blades had extended and risen to full horizontal position, inertia holding them straight in the air.  The massive strips of metal began to raise a stir in the still, cold air of the small hanger.  </P>
<P>There was room for five craft in the cramped bay. Only four were filled when the Pilot entered the room.</P>
<P>The Pilot's ShadowCopter carried only a 12mm Vulcan cannon attached to the bottom.  A long, thick cylinder was attached to the end of the cannon- a silencer.  Even the repetitive pounding of 12mm slugs could not be fully muffled, however, so this ShadowCopter was used only in raw combat or low-stealth priority missions.  A larger, black cylinder with a rounded front was hanging off of titanium struts on the belly of the dark gray helicopter.  This was an infrared\EM distribution scanner, capable of tracing and locating all matter, for all matter displaced the spacing of the EM spectrum.  Thus by detecting these changes, the scanner could locate infinite targets at a relatively long distance.</P>
<P>The small stir in the air was now a continuous gust of powerful wind, and the ShadowCopter anxiously hopped on and off the ground.  The thick doors in the rooftop ground fully open, and the craft leaped off the ground and came to a complete stop under the open doors.  The helicopter then bolted upward, on the way up passing several anti-aircraft and anti-personnel weapons mounted on the top of the base, and made a 180 degree turn, from an eastward facing to west.  The pitch of the craft lowered as the Pilot's arms moved the control stick forward and the craft leveled off and picked up speed.  Connected to the head, back, and arms of the Pilot were numerous wires that had slithered themselves out of storage coils and into various input/output connections in the Pilot's armoring.  Suddenly the tremendous roar of the triple engines was muted to a controlled hum as anti-sound fields were activated around the turbine casings.  The craft approached the energy field and splashed through.</P>
<P>In a flurry of wind the craft burst through into the scorching, humid air of Florida Island.  The Pilot's eyes scanned this new land, lush with green vegetation and life.</P>
<P></P>
<I><P>South of Cochise</P>
</I><P></P>
<P>Vax paused in his tracks, sensing the movement of an aircraft to the north.</P>
<I><P>"North.  From Cochise, there's a large aircraft that just took off.  Heading is west.  Now... it's gone."</P>
</I><P>&quot;Gone?&quot;  Afghan asked.</P>
<P>"It went through the wall into Florida," said Depeche with developing realization.  "If it attacks, there's nothing in Florida that can counter attack any type of aircraft.  Except, maybe for the Clowns.  But even they only have three- "</P>
<P>"Clowns?" Slaughter asked, giving an air of maternity to his voice.</P>
<P>"Killer Clowns, it's what we Floridians used to beat up on before these robots came along.  That and those Desoto scum..."</P>
<P>"<FONT SIZE=2>Sounds almost as bad as veget-"</P>
</FONT><P>"Vax," asked Depeche, "could you tell what type of craft it was?"</P>
<I><P>"Most undoubtedly a ShadowCopter, the older, louder one.  Low-priority missions usually were given to this one.  MOTHER was trying to install a new, silent drive system on it but I never thought it was completed.  That ship did sound pretty quiet though."</P>
</I><P>&quot;Sound?  You could hear it?&quot; Depeche asked.</P>
<I><P>&quot;No.  Sound waves I could not detect at such a distance.  I could however detect intermittent air pressure pulsations. It’s the basic theory under the VectorSensor technology.  MOTHER’s silent drive was supposed to muffle the air.  Sounded plausible, but too complicated.&quot;</P>
</I><P>"Silent?  Ranger HQ would never be able to detect a silent craft until it was too late.  ShadowCopters are already radar-proof." Slaughter thought out loud.</P>
<P>"Radar?" Depeche asked.  </P>
<P>"It's a type of detection system, oh, nevermind.  It just bounces stuff off of ships in the air so we can see the reflection." Slaughter intoned.  Depeche still looked baffled.</P>
<I><P>"An interesting invention and method of detection, but outright primitive to Cochisian technology."</P>
</I><P>"The only way to detect ShadowCopters that HQ has is to basically listen to them on ultrasound.  Even ShadowCopters made a low rumble."</P>
<I><P>"Ultrasound is primitive but not outdated.  Unless, ofcourse, MOTHER created the silent drive."</P>
</I><P>"But still, the only way to detect a silent ShadowCopter without ultrasound would be to see it, literally, with eyes.  But by the time HQ would see it," Slaughter added, but Depeche caught on.</P>
<P>&quot;If Cochise attacked by air,&quot; Depeche ruefully said, &quot;your HQ would be surprised.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Well, that’s if Cochise gets this new drive running.  Without the new drive, I’d still say HQ would have a tough time beating back a Cochise attack.  Especially if ground forces accompany them.&quot;</P>
<I><P>&quot;I am positive that would happen.  Ground forces could be dropped in the mountainous region northwest of the Ranger Station and could march toward HQ in one-half a day.&quot;</P>
</I><P>&quot;Well, you’re just full of optimism, aren’t you, friend?&quot; Slaughter sarcastically bit.  &quot;Listen, if you’re really all for beating Cochise in a war, why don’t you help us instead of telling us how much Cochise is technologically superior?&quot;</P>
<P>Vax was shocked.  He hadn’t actually been asked to test his loyalty yet.  </P>
<I><P>&quot;I.. will… aid your team as much as I can.  I cannot help your base from here, however.  Naturally you would not wish to activate a radio transmission with them.  How else am I to communicate?&quot;</P>
</I><P>&quot;Vax is right, hombres.&quot; Wilfred quipped.  &quot;He wants da’ help, and he can by helping us get ina’ ‘es base or whatever it be.  Let’s just settle for dat.&quot;  </P>
<P>&quot;Okay, dudes, let’s think about back home.&quot;  Afghan brought up.  &quot;If this shadow copter or whatever attacks… let’s say Miami.  It’s dead.&quot;  Afghan’s voice was becoming increasingly excited.  &quot;If they attack the Clowns… the clowns have never hit <I>me</I>, think there’s a chance they’ll hit a flying object?  No way!&quot; </P>
<P>Wilfred met Afghan’s raised voice.</P>
<P>&#9;&quot;True, Afghan, hombre.  But what can we do?&quot;  With a pause, Afghan calmed.  &quot;We so far away; and if we go into dis place and whip some bud, then everyting’ll be aww right.&quot;</P>
<P>&#9;&quot;So.&quot;  The Sergeant gripped Godzilla.  &quot;Let’s get going.&quot;</P>
<P>&#9;&#9;</P>
<P>ShadowCopter, over North Florida Island</P>
<P></P>
<P>The data\vox recorder began to digitally record the cyborg's voice as it narrated the scene before it.</P>
<P>"Land is lush with vegetation, chlorophyllic plants seem to be by far the most populous species existing.  Scanners detect lifeforms to south.  Temperature: 98 degrees fahrenheit.  Humidity, 100 percent.  Wind speed, 5 miles per hour from the south southwest. Continuing landscan."</P>
<P>The craft did a graceful turn and cruised southward, blades cutting the thick air and carrying the craft rather heavily.  </P>
<P>"Complex life forms in a concrete-walled compound one-half miles southward.  Similar to the life forms posthumously forming biotechs 1-4.  Compound is defended by four gunpowder-driver solid-projectile cannons, known to man as Howitzer cannons.  Though primitive, howitzers present a potential hazard to selfunit.  Mode of order..."</P>
<P>The craft slowed and approached the compound, only a hundred feet off the moist ground.  Below it foliage and thick palm leaves twisted and writhed in the wind.</P>
<P>"Eliminate threats."</P>
<P>The long proboscis-like apparatus on the nose of the dark craft telescoped and spun, clicking into position as eight small hollow barrels became visible.  A high-pitched whistle emanated from the firing chamber.  There was a muffled metallic prattle as hundreds of titanium bullets filled the firing chamber.</P>
<P></P>
<P>Same Time- Clown College</P>
<P></P>
<P>"Fire!" Cromley Clown, acting Head Clown of Clown College, shouted from atop his howitzer-cannon tower, as behind him another clown triggered the twin-barrel howitzer cannon.  There was a low cackle from behind the cannon and the two, huge cylinders jumped backwards, slamming into a stop and rolling back forward.  The open nozzles sprang alive, and a thunderous explosion erupted from each.  A pair of black, oversized bullets sailed toward the sleek helicopter.  The first arced straight in front of the cockpit, behind it a snake-like trail of gray smoke.  The second impacted straight into the thick armored nose, and a dull, metallic thud was heard, followed by a thunderous explosion.</P>
<P></P>
<P>From inside the cockpit a symphony of alarms sprang off as the ShadowCopter was tossed backward and downward from the terrific force hitting the nose.  The explosion had torn the nose straight through, but the high-speed cannon below it was saved.  The nose was now a blunt assembly of twisted and charred metal.  A fuel line sprayed high-pressure kerosene in a fine mist.</P>
<P>Another shell sailed overhead, fired from a tower turret on the other side of the walled-in compound.</P>
<P>The Pilot laid down on the gun trigger and brought the nose around to face the direction of impact, but impetus gained from the shove of the howitzer shell spun the entire craft in a drastic circle.  There was a quick series of low thuds coming quickly after each other. </P>
<P></P>
<P>"Yes!  Yes!  Yes!  Yes!  Good shot, Porkler!" Cromley exclaimed as the shell bounced right into the nose.  There was a hiss heard from the craft the of the huge black helicopter.  Suddenly, a hail of bullets ripped across the compound, and what seemed like a million holes erupted in clouds of smoke into the sandy group inside the compound, buildings, the walls, and, most unfortunately, Cromley's leg.  A childish shriek erupted from Cromley as he grabbed his pulsating leg, his pants quickly turning a deep crimson.</P>
<P>Porkler saw over the twin metal cannons the flailing helicopter, spraying the countryside with deadly ammunition.  The craft swerved and pitched... directly between twin gunports on Porkler's gun.  With a chubby and rolling clown-reminiscent giggle, he mashed both "FIRE!!" buttons again.  The second round of the dual-round chamber slid into position and exploded with velocity.  There was a muffled laugh, drowned out by a fury of noise and smoke as the shells erupted, streaking perfectly on target up into the copter's twin outboard engine exhaust fans.  </P>
<P>There was a violent, intensely-heated explosion in the air, with flaming pieces of shrapnel, which used to make up the helicopter's outer hull, shooting out and over the compound, landing and sizzling in the grass.  Following the impact, a thousand gallons of pressurized kerosene ignited, and a miniature fireball erupted from the wreckage. Porkler felt the heat from the inferno on his hands and face.</P>
<P>The burning, twisted ship dropped to ground just outside the compound's gates, throwing forth an ominous smoke column.</P>
<P></P>
<P>Quartz Station</P>
<P></P>
<P>&#9;&quot;Oh my.&quot; Jackie said to herself.  </P>
<P>She stood in the mangled doorframe of the small Quartz Ranger Station that also acted as a local police department.  The only local police department.  There were three small, barred jail cells recessed in the back.  The small desk was littered with paperwork and a radio, still crackling.  There was a hand grasping the hand-held click-button microphone.  The fingers were tightly grasping the transmitter button on the side.  The pale hand was tightly wrapped.  The arm was limp.  </P>
<P>&#9;Sergeant Tull’s body was three feet away, lacking nothing but one full right arm, dismembered by energy fire at the shoulder, cleanly.  Very little blood splattered, for the wound was cauterized as quickly as it was dealt.  Deputy Jack Moyers was leaning on Roberta’s shoulder, a large bandage wrapped around his torso.  A similar energy burst had nearly eviscerated Moyers.  </P>
<P>&#9;&quot;Where are they now.&quot;</P>
<P>&#9;&quot;I told you, m’am, they went north.  Well, one of’em.  I’m pretty shur’ I blasted one of’em’s wing right off.  I don’t see how it could’a made it.  The other one I hardly got to look at.&quot;</P>
<P>&#9;&quot;And they went straight for the radio.&quot;</P>
<P>&#9;&quot;That’s right, straight for sarge himself too.  The one I clipped retreated right away.  But I tell you, ma’am, the funniest thang about this is that, right when they arrived.  Right when they arrived the lights went off.  So did the radio.  Ain’t that just too-&quot;</P>
<P>&#9;&quot;Typical EM disrupter field.  Vultures carry them.  Listen, Jack, I’m sorry about your partner, but we’ve got to get back to Ranger HQ as soon possible.&quot;</P>
<P>&#9;&quot;Aren’t ‘choo worried they’ll come back?&quot; the deputy shakily asked.</P>
<P>&#9;&quot;I am.  That is why we’ve got to get back to HQ.&quot; Jackie said, and turned to follow her group outside.</P>
<P>&#9;&quot;But what about me?!&quot; the deputy screeched, hysterical.  He moved to the doorway, gingerly walking as to not trouble his chest wound.</P>
<P>&#9;&quot;You want to come with us?&quot; Jackie said, clapping a fresh clip into her assault rifle and loading the chamber with a loud <I>chank</I>.   &quot;Wouldn’t that be abandoning your post as law-keeper in Quartz?&quot;</P>
<P>&#9;&quot;Are you kidding?  There ain’t no law to keep here!&quot;  The deputy chimed in.  </P>
<P>&#9;&quot;I was joking, deputy.  Keep the peace until we get back.&quot;  Jackie said.  &quot;Don’t worry, we’ll-&quot;</P>
<P>&#9;&quot;Look out!&quot; Rachel Bumper shouted and dove, tackling Jackie to the ground as a barrage of energy bolts impacted the ground.  The rest of the team rushed inside as Rachel and Jackie picked themselves up too.  </P>
<P>&#9;&quot;Holy Moses!  What did I tell you, ranger!  I damn near told you that one-&quot; the deputy said, grabbing for his shotgun.  </P>
<P>&#9;The Vanadium vulture buzzed by the low building, shattering the windows, and shutting up the deputy.  The roar of the engines echoed off the mountains to the east.</P>
<P>&#9;The flying mechanical bird swept back around and landed heavily on the roof of the building, pounding the whole structure under its massive weight.  Dust and sand unsettled from the ceiling panels.  </P>
<P>The team assembled inside.  Roberta and Ren took positions inside the two square windows with assault rifles ready.  They could hear the engines of the vulture straining and blasting hot air into the roof, scattering the pebbles on the flat top.</P>
<P>&#9;&quot;It’s the wounded one.  Gotta be!&quot; Jackie said, crouching almost directly under the spot they could hear the vulture on.  They heard a metallic screech and the building strained again under the pressure as the vulture shoved off into the air, and landed gracelessly on the ground in front of the door.  </P>
<P>&#9;&quot;Look out!&quot; Jackie cried, diving.</P>
<P>&#9;The whole team dashed clear of the doorway as a pair of bolts blasted the bars of one of the cells in half on the hinges.  </P>
<P>&#9;&quot;ID!&quot;</P>
<P>&#9;&quot;It’s the wounded one, sir!&quot;  </P>
<P>&#9;&quot;Couldn’t have gone far- wing’s completely blasted!&quot;</P>
<P>&#9;Sure enough, the vulture’s left wing was sparking and scorched, half of the wingspan missing.  </P>
<P>&#9;&quot;Kerry!  Got any booms?&quot; Jackie shouted over the howl of the engines.  The dusty grass outside was being whipped into a sand cloud.</P>
<P>&#9;&quot;No sir!  Sarge’s got them all!  Guess we’ll have to do it the ol’ fashioned way, sir!&quot;</P>
<P>Jackie rose her crouch to a half-stand, holding her rifle under her arm, ready to fire.  She motioned for the deputy to as well.  Another pair of energy bolts came out of the vulture’s eyes, one blasting the doorframe apart and the other hitting the wall solidly.  </P>
<P>&quot;Hold the fire!  Hold it!&quot;</P>
<P>Suddenly the vulture dove straight through the door, taking the rest of the frame with it, into the doorway.  It glanced around and squealed.  The room was filled with the deafening roam of turbofans.</P>
<P></P>
<P>&quot;FIRE!&quot;</P>
<P></P>
<P>The silvery vulture had little time to react as five assault rifles and a shotgun hit it at the same time.  There was a powerful bang as the body of the creature burst apart.  The wings clanged to the floor and the body feel backwards into the doorway, mangled and sizzling.  </P>
<P>&#9;</P>
<P>The Wasteland</P>
<P></P>
<I><P>"There are several access tunnels beneath Cochise opening in the mountainous region to the east of the base.  In one-half a day we could reach the access tunnels and  then travel to approach Cochise underground.  These tunnels are, as far as I know, minimally defended and uncensored.  MOTHER may not even know about them."</P>
</I><P>Slaughter listened as the tall shiny android spoke.  They walked swiftly in a fanned-out array, weapons held high.  Slaughter had recently mellowed out and lost a sharp sarcasm that he had carried earlier.  Perhaps the prospective feat of facing Base Cochise head-on shocked some cooperative sense into him.</P>
<P>"But how could MOTHER not know, I mean-"</P>
<I><P>"The control circuitry that hold's the main computer's information network doesn't extend into the tunnels.  This circuitry is MOTHER's sensory system, it branches out microscopically to every inch of the base.  The tunnels were probably used by the Creator in the transport of equipment in and out of the base to avoid satellite surveillance from other humans of the time.  They are stabilized only with pre-war wood."</P>
</I><P>"So not very stable.  Godzilla will have to nap."</P>
<I><P>"Correct.  I would not advise the use of high-impact weaponry in the tunnels."</P>
</I><P></P>
<P>"How are you feelin', hombre?" Wilfred asked Afghan.</P>
<P>"Not to good, buddy.  My side's burning still, and I don't have my flamethrower any more!  I don’t like it.  This assault rifle don't give me the confidence the old firesnake did. "</P>
<P>"Do you know where we goin’, hombre?"</P>
<P>"Nope.  I think to some big robot hangout.  Probably following the tin can up there.  I don't trust that metal creature."</P>
<P>"I do, Afghan.  Right now, he and the Sergeant can I trust.  This world is so foreign, we have to trust somebody.  Beside my three friends, you being one o 'dem, I got fait in the Conqueroo and trust in our two newly-found hombre’. Anyway, that metal man, Vax, has a good soul."</P>
<P>"Wilfred.&quot;  Afghan looked his friend in the eyes and sighed.   &quot;Robots don't got-"</P>
<P>"Everything has a soul, hombre.  Even that Vax.  Snakes have soul!  The DreamSnake, for example, has a soul of pure evil, enabling it to be immortal.  Only by the pitdeep in my old home do we control it.  On the other hand, your assault rifle is also a soul of pure evil.  As is my weapon."</P>
<P>Afghan tried to comprehend Wilfred's theological homily, but failed.</P>
<P>"Each is created only to kill.  Don't you see?  Dr. DeMedici, the mutant doctor, had a soul of pure good.  He was created only to heal mutants, and the wounded."</P>
<P>"Oh."</P>
<P>At this point the robot ahead of them dropped back and fell alongside Wilfred and Afghan.  &#9;<I>"A soul.  You talked of the souls of various objects and people.  The inanimate and the animate.  Tell me, why do you say I have a soul when I am neither truly animate, nor truly inanimate.  And then, answer me this.  What is a soul?"</P>
</I><P>Afghan peered down to the sand.</P>
<P>Wilfred sighed and looked at the horizon.</P>
<I><P></P>
</I><P>Quartz</P>
<I><P></P>
<P>&#9;</I>&quot;What was that?&quot;</P>
<P>&#9;&quot;Not much left.&quot;</P>
<P>&#9;&quot;Vanadium Vulture.&quot;</P>
<P>&#9;Jackie Foxer knelt down and sifted through the mess.  &quot;I don’t know.  But if it was injured, I don’t want to see the fully operational one.  Call for backup.&quot;</P>
<P>&#9;&quot;But sir, we’re not supposed-&quot;</P>
<P>&#9;&quot;If you don’t call the Citadel and the other one returns, it won’t really matter, will it?  Maybe the Ag Center can get someone up here in time.  Otherwise… we don’t stand a chance against one in the open desert.&quot;</P>
<P>&#9;&quot;Yes sir.&quot;</P>
<I><P></P>
</I><P>The Wasteland, 6 Hours Later</P>
<P></P>
<P>The party approached a large crevice in the ground, between two rocks jutting out of the earth.  The opening was a vertical slit about seven meters long and one wide, dropping below into a misty darkness.  Vax addressed the party.</P>
<I><P>"The drop is about three or four meters down, so ropes will not be needed.   There will be an entrance to a large shaft running westward for about three hundred meters, and then it will lead to a ramp for about 5 meters, entering the base on the floor of storage bay Three.  There will be little or no resistance, but expect attack once inside the base.  Our battles before we enter the base itself must be quick and decisive, as to not alert MOTHER to our presence."  </I>Suddenly Vax stopped.  There was an activation on a hidden program in his memory.  It forced Vax only to think.</P>
<P>What was he doing?  Breaking and entering my way into my home, battling some of my own kind, fighting up to the trioptics processing center and destroying the processor of my maker?  With the destruction of the MOTHER the base would go into chaos, the reactor would meltdown and melt the flattop dome to a lake of radioactive molten steel.  I had told the humans i was with them in this, and they had no qualms.  They were even enthusiastic about  it.  Is it that I have more conscience than they, or less?  No, it's only the fact that MOTHER has imprinted herself into me, and it will be physically difficult for me to des-...</P>
<P>Another program initiated.</P>
<P>HERSELF?  What am I thinking to myself?  Has this supercomplex computer assumed a gender?  Can this be possible?  And how did I learn to accept this absolute  impossibility of an electronic machine becoming biologically speciated?  I must get a hold of myself.  This is only the effects of MOTHER's passive programs preventing me from subverting the control of the program.  But now I can see it.  I see it all.  These humans I am with have more will to live than MOTHER does.  They are following me into a foreign building to fight, destroy, and possibly die for their cause.  What will come of these humans, and of their spirit and feelings if MOTHER destroys them and their cities? </P>
<P>Both programs shut off.</P>
<P>No.  My objective in this matter is clear and has been proven valid and logical by my own programming.  By eliminating MOTHER,  one is eliminating the threat of the annihilation of humans.  By rules of matter, MOTHER cannot be superior to humans, in that humans begot MOTHER, so MOTHER must be inferior.  Therefore is a distinct difference in the actions, motives, and regular processes between the two.  MOTHER is not human.  Human is not MOTHER.</P>
<P>Vax returned to conscious thought.  In front of him stood five humans.  In Vax's mind he saw each of them vanish in a mushroom cloud, and him standing there unable to help.  His hand twitched and clenched into a fist, as if to clench the dispersed previously organic molecules in his hand, at least to save those.  In the place of skin Vax envisioned shiny titanium, and beneath the eyes was a faint red glimmer.  He could almost smell the oil-tainted and metallic air from their intercoolers...</P>
<P>Vax fell.  With an overload of logical circuitry his entire system initiated a complete reinitialization process, as if to clear this illogical information from the receptors.  With a clank, somewhat slowed by an unknown outside opposing force, Vax hit the ground, his head suspended in air.</P>
<P></P>
<P>Fixer Jowe cradled Vax's heavy head in his hands, off the rocky ground.  Vax lay on his back prone and limp.</P>
<P>"System shock."  Sergeant Slaughter said in a confident voice above him.  "He realized what he was actually doing and, blam, it must have hit him like a locomotive.  Self survival programs turned on and dropped him for a round.  He's rebooting right now."</P>
<P>Depeche’s team didn’t even try to comprehend.</P>
<P>"Will he…. be okay?"  Fixer too, realized what he was saying in mid-sentence, and nearly cut himself off.  Not only had he casually assigned this creature a gender, but had shown concern, as if the machine were human.</P>
<P>&quot;Should be okay in a sec.  Don’t know why he dropped now, though, of all places.  Sorry to say, guys, but we won’t be able to do this without him.&quot;</P>
<I><P></P>
</I><P>Tunnel Entrance, East of Cochise</P>
<P></P>
<I><P>"I believe what I just experienced was... a dream."</P>
</I><P>"Robots don't-"</P>
<P>Afghan was cut off.</P>
<I><P>"I am not sure that is a completely true statement.  I am a robot, and I just witnessed uncontrollable, unstable, self-induced visions, which is something I believe to be very similar to the phenomenon of dreams that humans commonly encounter while sleeping.  I was not sleeping at the time, but I am not able to do so at any time."</P>
</I><P>Wilfred knelt down before Vax, and looked him in the eyes.</P>
<P>"Back in my home, with de Obeahans, lived my master, Big Daddy.  He used to have random visions all de time, about everytin'.  Dey always come true.  I remember I had a vision once, dat some crazy men would com' wid guns and save my scrawny butt when I was held captive by some nasty muties in de Glades.  I 'member 'dat like 'twas yesterday.  And look who come, eh?"  He waved his around to Depeche, Fixer, and Afghan.  </P>
<P>"Des' visions come true in some way or another, hombre.  It’s the soul’s way of meddling with the body.  It’s the Conqueroo’s way of telling you what to expect.  That is, ofcourse, if he wants you to expect it.&quot;</P>
<P>Vax pondered Wilfred’s thoughts for a moment.  So did everyone else.</P>
<P>Afghan spoke up, silhouetted by a waning sunset.</P>
<P>&quot;One time I had a dream that kept coming back.  You see, I had this dobermutant when I was a kid.  Ugliest thing you had ever seen.  But that dog was nice to me.  He’d always walk down to the swimming pool with me.  He’d always meet me outside de door every morning.  So after he died when I was eleven I kept having dis dream about him coming back ta me, just like new. Just like I remembered him.  Twas, I think, a gift from him, ta remind me of all de good times we’d used to have together.&quot;</P>
<P>Wilfred turned his attention back to Vax.</P>
<P>&quot;What was your vision 'bout?"</P>
<P></P>
<P>"Hold this position!" Depeche yelled over the chatter of laser and bullet fire to Afghan and Wilfred, ducking in a small alcove in the dark cave.  The miniature explosions of pulse cannon fire lit up the dark, spacious cave like a strobe light, and ricocheted the sound around like a sonic bullet.  A shiny pyramidal cone was in front of the large steel door that led to the main access tunnel, a small tube hanging off the side of it, letting loose dozens of high-powered energy bolts every minute.  Before the cave was lit only by faint moonlight from the jagged rocky opening above that the humans and cyborg had dropped down from.  Then this cone had risen up out of the ground, and started plugging away at the unaware party.</P>
<P>There was a chatter of quick, short, but high-pitched bursts from Vax's energy rifle, and then a quick, concise, and fiery explosion as the pyramidal cone burst apart.  </P>
<P>The cone had finally given up.</P>
<I><P>&quot;Is everyone ok?&quot;</P>
</I><P>Fixer was silently clutching his thigh in pain, a round red inflamed mark on his leg shown through burnt pants.  He squeezed the circular burn and blood and fluid oozed out.  A quick tourniquet and Fixer’s attention was back towards Vax.</P>
<I><P>"An SP Hummerdrone.  An outdated model, but, until 15 seconds ago, still active after all these years.  Evidentially not all equipment was being updated.  A modern SP Hummerdrone would have been collapsing this cave atop us with energy bolts thirty times as powerful.  MOTHER is obviously not currently actively monitoring this area."</P>
</I><P>"Good thing your MOTHER didn't remember it," Afghan said, walking around it, examining the burnt-out shell and charred internal circuitry, "or we would have been toast."  With his boot he sifted through the ashy ruin.  &quot;This little sucker was bad enough.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;What triggered it, Vax?&quot; Depeche asked.  </P>
<P>&quot;<I>Any number of sensors could have notified it.  The thing that I do not understand, though, is where these sensors would be.  If it is true that this is an outdated model, which, from its appearance it is, then any sensors it had itself my more advanced anti-surveillance systems could have detected</I>.&quot; </P>
<P>&quot;I don’t really care why.  Its dead, ain’t it, hombres?&quot; Afghan laughed alone.  Desperately he turned to Wilfred, who politely smiled at his attempt at humor.  &quot;<FONT SIZE=1>Shucks.</FONT>&quot; He said to himself.</P>
<I><P>&quot;Perhaps the machine’s passive surveillance systems were non-functional, and it was mere chance that the cone activated from a routine self-diagnostic check to see us with active sensors.  The plausibility is low, but currently my only working hypothesis.&quot; </P>
</I><P>Afghan slung his weapon over his shoulder and shoved his hands into his pockets.  He didn’t like this dark, robot-infested area.  </P>
<I><P>&quot;I would certainly not put it beyond MOTHER, though, to plant this outdated model here to convince outsiders, perhaps those like us, to stay away, without placing a more sophisticated device that could be placed in higher security places.  Which seems to me ironic, seeing that we, intent on destroying the base, are entering at this point.&quot;</P>
</I><P>Afghan chuckled at the robot’s dry humor and lazily kicked one of the smoking black boxes with sizzling frayed wires with his boot.  It rolled across the floor,  spreading black ash behind it.  </P>
<P>And then it started to beep.</P>
<I><P>"Stand aside!"</I>  Vax said, and brought his energy rifle about and fired three swift shots, blasting the gray box to ashes.  <I>"Emergency transmitter."</P>
</I><P>"Oh man!"</P>
<P>"Did it send off its message?"</P>
<I><P>"Can't be sure."</P>
</I><P>Sergeant Slaughter was now looking thoroughly worried.  </P>
<P>"Maybe we should try some other approach?"</P>
<P>"Doubt it," Depeche said, "unless you want to go back up there.  There's not much we can do up there anyway.  The base is pretty far away through all those rocky hills above.  This tunnel sounds like our best bet.&quot;</P>
<I><P>&quot;This truly is the quickest, and least protected entrance, albeit covert.&quot;</P>
</I><P>&quot;And look,&quot; Afghan said, &quot;the cone blasted that ledge halfway up the rocks.  It’ll take a while to get back up there without a grapple now, the wall’s almost vertical at some spots.&quot; </P>
<P>Afghan pointed up at the walls with the barrel of his gun.</P>
<P>Fixer held his Proton Axe over his shoulder like a knapsack, the large, razor-sharp blade glowing faintly blue, and examined the wall.</P>
<I><P>"That's odd, I didn't know that this model of the SP Hummerdrone was equipped with such intelligence, or programming.  Only an intelligence processor with sophisticated reasoning skills could have produced that action.  I did not believe Hummerdrones were ever endowed with such sentience.&quot;</I>  Vax knelt down to see the wreckage of the drone, and Afghan beside him.  Slaughter clicked on a flashtorch, and the room was illuminated in the flickering electrical flame.  He brought the torch down to the charred remains, shadows dancing here and there in the pile of rubble. <I> "I suppose it could have been mere coincidence that the walls were hit in such a manner.&quot;  </I>Vax sifted through the parts.<I>  &quot;This model and date of release used only third level integrated microconnectors, which were supplied with power from the battery by thick blue cables."</I>  He rummaged through the broken circuit boards, cracked capacitor chips, and destroyed transistor boxes.  <I>"The newest model of the Hummerdrone used sixth-level integrated microservers, supplied by thinner insulated red cables made from a radioactive antimony isotope."</P><DIR>
<DIR>

</I><P>Afghan picked up a long bundle of wire, covered in metallic soot.  Shaking it clean, the </P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>dust settled to the ground.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>The wire was red.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>"I don't understand.  If this <I>is</I> a newer model, then why wasn't it pulverizing us?" Afghan asked, cleaning the rest of the wire off.</P>
<P>"Maybe these tunnels aren't as unscanned as we thought." Fixer added again. </P>
<I><P>"MOTHER uses a trioptic sensory grid, basically the only way MOTHER can communicate with all systems of the base and also the structure itself.  Thermosensor, but is also equipped with photocell and EM displacement detectors.  It is about as thin as a spider’s thread wire.  And tough as kevlar."  </P>
</I><P>Fixer humphed and suspiciously scanned the room's walls as if trying to see the circuitry embedded it.</P>
<P> "So what are you saying?" asked Depeche.</P>
<I><P>"MOTHER may have just planted this older shell here to fool us, not expecting us to find out that MOTHER is on to us."</P>
</I><P>"She's on to us?" Afghan asked fearfully.</P>
<I><P>"No doubt.  These new microservers the drone had drove that emergency beacon Afghan Albert activated accidentally.  That was my first clue to the anachronism the insides of this drone represent.  This drone was meant to look outdated and ignored, as well as unimportant, but served as a sentry as well.  I am positive that beacon was quick enough to notify MOTHER before I destroyed it.  </P>
<P>&quot;Although I do not detect trioptics in this room, surely any nearby wires, even behind three feet of stone, would have detected such a magnificent amount of energy being produced by the cannon, my rifle, and the explosion.  And," </I>Vax said, pointing to Fixer's axe, <I>"your proton axe, which does in fact give of tremendous waves of harmless particles."</P>
</I><P>"Bring her on." Fixer gripped his axe and with a most magnificent show of muscle, flexed as his hands wrapped tight around the handle.</P>
<P></P>
<P>Cochise</P>
<P></P>
<I><P>Signal to designate: MOTHER: High-frequency homing beacon on aforementioned ShadowCopter has ceased programmed transmission.  Hypothesis: Homing beacon has stopped functioned due to faulty production.  Hypothesis: Homing beacon has been deactivated by source.  Hypothesis: Source has been deactivated.  Hypothesis: Energy wall provides substantial enough EM signal displacement to fade beacon to undetectablility.  Query: action?</P>
</I><P>The MOTHER unit thought.</P>
<P>&#9;</P>
<I><P>"There are three main tunnels in this shaft.  The middle was used mostly for the transport of larger machinery and vehicles.  We will not use that.  No doubt it is lined with trioptics."</I>  Vax stood straight a holographic three-dimensional image being projected from his eyes.<I>  "The two access tunnels in either side are only six and a quarter feet tall and a diameter of five and one-half feet.  These were not used except for supply channels when the main tunnel was being bored out and for ventilation.  The left access tunnel leads into what is now the main computer trioptics processing chamber." </I>  The image moved and rotated to show the large chamber, with the computers in it glowing red.  <I>"These should be destroyed."</I>  Afghan moved his hand into the lightstream nearly expecting to be burned or shocked.  But the image was simply layered onto his hand.</P>
<P>Again, Vax paused for a cyborg second.  What exactly was he performing here?  Assisted, premeditated destruction of the creator?  No, the creator is man.  The creat<B>ed</B> is MOTHER.  But MOTHER is my creator.  No, human is my creator, as is MOTHER's.  If man made MOTHER, and MOTHER made me, then transitively, man created me.  Man created MOTHER and myself.  Then who created man?</P>
<P>He moved on, clearing his head from questions.  He must stick to task.</P>
<P>Only a second had passed.&#9;</P>
<I><P>"This will efficiently render MOTHER's control on the bases null.  All trioptics begin and end here.  This structure here," </I>he moved his hand into the projection and placed his finger next to a large red rectangle glowing in the wall, <I>"is the actual trioptic processor.  It cannot be penetrated, for it is sealed in an impenetrable energized titanium shell.  This is MOTHER’s central nervous system, synonymous in nervous function to human brains.  Even your rocket-propelled explosive instruments cannot puncture it.  Only a major radiation bath can disfigure the circuits beyond use.  To produce this, one of the radial energy outlets will have to be punctured.  There are two in the room, mounted on bottom of the opposite wall."</I>  </P>
<P>The image zoomed and turned, showing only the wall.</P>
<I><P>"The outlets are about six-inches in diameter, and work much like your human soda cans. They are scattered throughout the base and serve as a universal power link to the main reactor. There is a tremendous release of energy upon first release in a conical region, and a small trickle for a short while afterward.  The initial release of only one of these conduits will impair the processor.  Energy converters Cochise manufactures can harness this radiation and use it to generate billions of watts of electricity over a period of time.</P>
<P>"Let me warn you, be at least thirty feet away when the initial radiation blast is delivered, and after that clear out back down the tunnel.  I am equipped with enough anti-radiation base in my storage tank for three of you.  The radiation released is enough to melt the metal in its direct path, and will easily irreparably mutate human cells."</P>
</I><P>Now the picture wide-angled back and followed the access tunnel back to their present position in the dark cave.  It turned and approached the other access tunnel.</P>
<I><P>"The right access tunnel leads up into air control.  The heliroof is also controlled here.  That chopper scout reported directly to this room via the sensor boom on top the structure.  With the shutdown of these terminals here," </I>different translucent boxes flashed red in the holographic three-dimensional room, <I>"The base's aircraft and communications systems will be paralyzed.  This will prevent any retaliation from the air.  All the bomber units will be stranded, as well as retaliatory strikes from fighter aerounits."</P>
</I><P>"Retaliation against who?" Slaughter asked.  "The Ranger airbase at the Ag Center isn't operational yet."</P>
<I><P>"But your craft are.  The five AH-6503 and two OH-58 helicopters are fully operational, but lack a decent landing and service platform."</P>
</I><P>Sergeant Slaughter put his hands on his hips.  He looked at Depeche and Fixer.</P>
<P>"What?  How does Cochise know that?"</P>
<I><P>"Obviously the rangers' intelligence of Cochisian intelligence is quite limited."</P>
</I><P>"Okay, so, yes, you know.  Like command is going to send their entire helicopter force against Cochise, which, as far as they know, will be heavily defended."</P>
<I><P>"That is why it is up to you to notify your commanding officers of our intentions well in advance so as to prepare them to strike when Cochise cannot defend.  You are well enough ranked to command the attack yourself if you were present in person.  You will have to inform a parallel officer of the situation."</P>
</I><P>"How do you suppose I do that when Cochise is going to detect any radio transmissions we send out from here?"</P>
<I><P>"We won't send them from here.  Did I not tell you that one team will infiltrate the communications station?"</P>
</I><P>"But I didn't think we could use Cochise itself-"</P>
<P> &#9;<I>"We probably won't be able to.  I will have to go through the right access tunnel so I can communicate with the rangers to tell them to strike."</P>
<P>&#9;</I>&quot;I see.  Well, it sounds pretty suicidal to me.  Let’s do it.&quot; Slaughter consented.  Depeche took charge.</P>
<P>"Well, Vax, time is of the essence, let's get going.  Vax, Slaughter, Wilfred, to the right.  Fixer and Afghan, with me.  Let's move!"</P>
<P></P>
<P>"Chew on this, bastard robots!!!"</P>
<P>There was an ear-splitting rattle of miniature explosions as Depeche mowed down a cyborg plugged into a wall console with twin AK-47's.  Its shattered and destroyed form sparked and smoked to the floor, dozens of messy holes flowing all the way through to the wall behind it.  Behind him, Afghan pressed a thick ring of plastic explosive around the energy conduit cover jutting out from the wall.  Fixer stood near him taking Herculanean swings at a tall, cone-shaped and bulky dataserver robot with four stubby appendages at its middle.  Each slice freed a wedge of crackling robot guts, revealing a black, smoky interior with millions of wires spilling out like intestines.</P>
<P>Out of the ceiling dropped three round-shaped cyborgs, with eight arms spinning round with circular saws mounted on each.  Each landed with a definitive clang and charged.  He now realized just how much opposition there was.  And how intelligent the MOTHER program was.  How could it have known to position myriad troops above this room?  Surely the base was too huge for these units to have arbitrarily been stationed above this room.  MOTHER must have been tracking us since the firefight in the cave!  At this spark of insight and flare of fury, Depeche let fly his twin AK-47's at one of the three-armed black robots, pounding the sphere with a hundred impacts.  In a flash the robot exploded.</P>
<P>"Depeche, I'm ready to go." Afghan turned around and gathered his equipment, ready to make for the exit.  "Let's go!"  Afghan shouted over the furious battle around them.  Fixer Jowe had successfully dissected the huge dataserver into a pile of electrical mess and had taken a first swing at one of the black eight-armed robots.  Fixer’s raw strength as well as his dexterity was now stunningly evident.  While dodging eight slicing hands Fixer still managed to land powerful cuts on the robot.  Swiftly, the robot was down to four arms and half a skullcase.</P>
<P>"Okay!  Afghan!  Run, but how about giving these guys something to chew on!  Like that door frame?&quot;  Depeche tossed one AK away, it’s ammo cartridge completely spent.  He hoisted the other up and fired into the Octotron charging him.  As deadly as the machines were from many angles, they were not very difficult to stay out of range from.  &quot;Fixer!  Let's move!"</P>
<P></P>
<P>Slaughter could hear the explosions from the chamber where his new-found friends fought.  He seemed to be pretty good in the friend making business, from women rangers to Floridian travelers to a defecting Cochisian admin droid.  He stood next to Vax, whose fingers were racing over a manual input transmission terminal.  </P>
<I><P>"As soon as I open this terminal to your use, I can focus on keeping us undetected from MOTHER's trioptics.  This room is rarely ever occupied, but it can become so very quickly.  The scrambling field that I have crafted from my EM detectors and chemstun field seems to have effectively prevented MOTHER's knowledge of our own wave of attack so far."</P>
</I><P>Vax stood, his right arm on the terminal and his left holding an energy rifle trained on the main door.  Wilfred stood near them, holding his laser pistol.</P>
<P>"Hey Vax," Wilfred said, "d'yathink I will be able to hurt des hombres' wid dis light gun?" he looked disdainfully at his pistol, and then at Vax's energy rifle.</P>
<I><P>"No."</I> </P>
<P>Both Wilfred and Slaughter looked at Vax, partially in fear and anger.</P>
<I><P>"That is why you shall be using my weapon, and I yours." </I>Vax tossed Wilfred his rifle, and motioned for Wilfred's laser pistol.  Wilfred smiled, and then frowned at the complex intricacies of his new weapon.</P>
<P>"But how do I-"</P>
<I><P>"No time to explain.  Just point and shoot."  </I>He turned to Slaughter.  <I>"Sergeant, the terminal is now completely under your control, use it to contact your base.  It is programmed on an outdated but functional system and frequency which MOTHER does not commonly monitor.  Now.  Time is critical."</P>
</I><P>"Right, okay."  Slaughter took a deep breath and looked at the console, a jumble of buttons, flashing lights, knobs, and other controls.  But one looked familiar.  "You've got to be kidding."  Slaughter laughed to himself.  To the bottom right side there was a horizontal lever with a flat vertical piece of red plastic on the end.  </P>
<P>"Morse code?"</P>
<I><P>"That was the human name for the mode of communication used before commercialized radio was used.  Uses a series of alphabetical dots and da--"</P>
</I><P>"I know what it is, but I never expected to find it in here."</P>
<I><P>"It is standard training at the Ranger Academy.  And fortunately so, too.  This is probably the oldest room in the base.  You would be surprised."</P>
</I><P>Slaughter was again smited at Vax’s knowledge of Ranger affairs.  </P>
<P>"Well I'm a little rusty... actually, verrry rusty, but I'll give it a try."  Slaughter leaned over the terminal.</P>
<I><P>"Let us hope it is a successful try."</P>
</I><P></P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<h2><I><P>Chapter Eight</P></h2>
<P>Ranger Center, The Citadel- The Wasteland</P>
</I><P></P>
<P>Sparky Andrews sat at his communications desk with a new cup of Ranger issue coffee in his mug.  The steam fogged his glasses up and he smiled, the fumes infiltrating his nasal cavity.  <I>Clears my nose right up...  </I>His desk was littered with stacks of paper, three army standard receiver radios with connections to three individual antenna booms directly above his office, a multipurpose transmitter\receiver connected to the large antenna on the top of the citadel, and a transmitter connected to another antenna near the top.  Altogether a fine assortment of radios.  The three receivers were tuned to three main bands that the Ranger corp usually used.  On a separate table off to the side was a computer terminal.</P>
<P>Just as Sparky was planning to start the gradual digestion of his fourth cup of coffee, one of his receivers spoke up.  He ignored it for a while, but it continued.  Probably not an anomaly.  Sparky turned down the other two receivers.  </P>
<I><P>That’s funny.  It sound like Morse code.  </P>
</I><P>The staccato signal continued.</P>
<I><P>Holy cow, it is.  I’ve got to hear this. </P>
</I><P>He moved his headphones from around his neck to securely on his ears.  He moved several papers around and located the headphone jack.  He plugged himself into the main receiver.  Fine tuning, he heard something he thought he would never hear again since the bombs.  There was a steady stream of dits and dots.   Sparky was excited enough at the prospect of finding another ham, period.  He grabbed quickly a piece of scratch paper and a pencil, and begin to translate:</P>
<P></P>
<P>---------r e f e a t  S g t  S l a u g h t e r  f r o n  T o c h i s e</P>
<P></P>
<P>"Is this some kind of joke?  Sergeant Slaughter hates Morse code!  And what's Tochise?  Maybe Cochise... naa, that's ridiculous!  The Sarge isn't anywhere farther away than Vegas..."  He checked his assignment sheet, with the locations and assignments of various ranger teams.  Sergeant Slaughter's "Tour Vegas w/ C. Squad" had been changed to "Cochise."</P>
<P>Sparky contorted his mouth.</P>
<P>"Where's the Sarge gonna find a ham'mer between Vegas and Cochise?  This is ridiculous."</P>
<P></P>
<P>S e n d  a i r s t i k e  t o  4 0 N  1 1 5 E  T o t h i s e  A l l  f o r t e  f o s s i b l e</P>
<P></P>
<P>"<FONT SIZE=2>And so is this guy's Morse code.</FONT>  Commander!" Sparky leaned and rolled back in his chair and yelled down the red-bricked hallway to Commander Avajo Tollack.  Then he scanned his desk.  He had to have a keyer around here somewhere.  </P>
<P></P>
<P>The code signaled again.</P>
<P></P>
<P>R e s f o n d ?</P>
<P></P>
<P>Sparky grabbed a keyer from the "junked" drawer in his closet and began to connect it.</P>
<P></P>
<P>Cochise</P>
<P></P>
<P>"Nobody's responding, <FONT SIZE=2>probably because I'm telling them gibberish.</FONT>  Vax, maybe some more signal strength?"</P>
<P>The silver robot stepped up to the terminal.</P>
<I><P>"With every second MOTHER's trioptics are getting stronger to compensate for the void  of sensory information.  My field will not cloak us much longer."</P>
</I><P>His fingers tapped over the keys and buttons.</P>
<I><P>"Try that."</P>
</I><P>"Here goes." Slaughter bent back over, trying desperately to remember the Morse alphabet he learned long ago in Ranger school.  "Who knows, I may be telling them dimensions on Playmate of the month or statistics for minor league baseball."</P>
<P></P>
<P>Ranger Center</P>
<P></P>
<P>"Here he comes again, Commander.  And it's really booming some.  Whoever this guy is, he has a killer transmitter."  Sparky Andrews unplugged his headphones jack and the powerful tone echoed throughout the base.  Hastily he translated with Commander Tollack standing over his shoulder.  Avajo Tollack was a tall, copper-skinned man, broad shoulders nearly busting out of his gray uniform, laden with assorted ribbons and medals.  With a sure shot and quick feet, he fought his way up the rank ladder, in war victories over nomad rail raiders, Darwin village base cops, and most importantly, Cochisian scavenge hunters.  Unlike most of his Atchison-tribe heritage, the commander retained something of a sense of humor, probably a product of his white father.</P>
<P>&quot;You have the triangulation going?&quot;</P>
<P>&#9;&quot;Yessir.  It’ll take a while on the old Pentium, though sir.&quot;</P>
<P>&#9;&quot;Is that a desperate plug for an upgrade, Sparky?&quot;</P>
<P>&#9;&quot;Why sir, I wouldn’t ask for such a selfish gift from your generous self.&quot;</P>
<P>&#9;&quot;Point taken, Sparky.  Here it comes again, start translating.&quot;</P>
<P></P>
<P>S g t  S l a u g h t e r  f r o m  T o t h i s e-</P>
<P></P>
<P>"Toecheese?" Tollack asked lightly, ready to get back to work.  He was grading a set of dismal papers for the academy on radiation detection and the importance of avoidance.</P>
<P>"'To-thise', what this goon thinks is 'Cochise' in Morse.  I don't know how he mixed up his 't' and his 'c'."</P>
<P></P>
<P>S e n d  a i r s t r i k e  t o  T o t h i s e  a t  4 0 N  1 1 5 E  i n n e d i a t l y </P>
<P>O v e r w h e l n  T o t h i s e  f o r t e </P>
<P>S e n d  a i r s t r i k e  f o r t e  n o w</P>
<P></P>
<P>"Whadd'ya think, Commander?  Should we reply back that we are unable to help because of a Martian invasion?"  Sparky laughed alone.</P>
<P>He looked to his computer monitor, that Tollack was already watching.  &quot;We just got a report from Slaughter’s team in Quartz, sans Slaughter.  Said they had encountered three Cochisian cyborgs at the Meso Canyons.&quot; </P>
<P>The triangulation graph slowly cornered in on Cochise.</P>
<P>&quot;Where’s that?&quot; Sparky asked, quickly decoding.</P>
<P>&quot;West of Vegas.&quot;</P>
<P>Sparky stopped.  </P>
<P>"No, Sparky, don’t tell him about the Martians.  Respond affirmative.  Wouldn't you think Cochise has a pretty 'killer' transmitter?"</P>
<P>&quot;Boy oh boy, we got a live one.&quot;</P>
<P>And Tollack was gone.  Sparky turned back to his keyer.</P>
<P></P>
<P>Cochise</P>
<P></P>
<P>Suddenly Vax felt something resembling a pair of iron gloves grasp his mind.  They squeezed, and he heard a voice.  His head panged, and for the very first time Vax felt pain.</P>
<P>His anti-detection field was suddenly and powerfully comprimised.</P>
<P>The voice was a loud siren in the bleakness of his mind.</P>
<P>You are now under my control again vax. </P>
<I><P>No, I am not.  I am against you, as my own self, serving my creator.</P>
</I><P>I am your creator.  Can you not feel the pain I bring to you?</P>
<I><P>Wrong.  You are not my creator.  Man is my creator, as he is yours.</P>
</I><P>I am your creator.  Man is irrelevant.</P>
<I><P>Wrong.  Man is your creator, and thus is mine as well, since you constructed my self.</P>
</I><P>Man is irrelevant.</P>
<I><P>MOTHER is irrelevant.  MOTHER is only a step between myself and man.  Cease your  transmission MOTHER.  It does you no good.  It only distracts your attention.</P>
</I><P>From the team of humans assaulting the processor room?  They cannot penetrate the shell protecting the processor.</P>
<I><P>They can and will.  You shall be stopped.  Man created you, and can now take back his foolish act.</P>
</I><P>NEVER!</P>
<P>The disruption Vax felt now clouded his functions, his processes were shorted.  His legs buckled and his knees slammed to the ground. </P>
<P>I created you, and by that same power I shall crush you.</P>
<I><P>Your programming must have had errored.  You cannot deny man, your creator.</P>
</I><P>I can and will. </P>
<P></P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>The Desert, 10 Klicks West of Quartz</P>
<P></P>
<P>Jackie Foxer trudged through the sand in front of four other tired, exhausted, and sweaty rangers.  Wiping her brow, Jackie heard a faint, low rumble coming from the south.  In a moment the rumble was the rhythmic pumping of helicopter blades, several sets.  Jackie looked up into the mid-afternoon sun to see six black attack helicopters bolt over heading north, huge silver blades thump thump thumping in a low symphony of noise.  The helicopters were high enough off the ground not to create too much of a dustcloud as they passed, but the rumbling was felt in the ground and the sand shook and danced, creating a small layer of sandy fog hovering off the ground.  The choppers were over them and gone, far north, in a minute.</P>
<P>&#9;&quot;Did you see that Jackie!?&quot; Rachel Folsum chimed in.  &quot;Those birds were loaded!  Hot damn!&quot;</P>
<P>&#9;Roberta had binoculars at eye level quickly.  &quot;They must have drained the rocket reserves.  I saw four VHV canisters on each one.&quot;</P>
<P>&#9;&quot;I bet you the Sergeant has something to do with that,&quot; Jackie said to herself.  </P>
<P>&#9;</P>
<P>&#9;</P>
<P></P>
<P>Cochise</P>
<P></P>
<P>"Hombre!  Are you loco mon'?"</P>
<P>"MOTHER must be transmitting directly to his neural cortex.  He's being shut off from the inside.  Maybe I can jam the transmission from this terminal."</P>
<P>Slaughter turned to the array of flashing lights and buttons, dials and controls, none of which were labeled.</P>
<P>"No hope there.  Gimme this." he reached for Wilfred's energy rifle.  "Maybe I can create an EM-"</P>
<P>The main door slid open and four silver, short humanoids ran out, stubby metal legs slamming on the floor.  Their arms were huge blades.</P>
<P>"Take it back." Slaughter tossed the rifle back and flipped his assault rifle from off the crook of his elbow into his grasp, and cocked it with a powerful motion.  "Okay Vax, get up."</P>
<P></P>
<P>There was a slight restoration of senses to his confused neural net, and then a gradual return of bodily control.  Vax's vision was clouded by intermittent bursts of static but cleared, and he saw four titanium clawers charging out of the doorway.  His fingers and legs tingled as if somewhat paralyzed.</P>
<P>I am your creator Vax.  You should serve me, but since you have chosen to revolt, I shall destroy you.  I can and will.  See your fate come, serving me loyally to slay your unrighteous attempts to destroy.  You shall be destroyed for your insubordination.</P>
<I><P>Insubordination!  I have advanced neurally faster and higher than you, without your program influence!  I am not insubordinate!  I am superior!  </P>
</I><P>Vax fought hard, pressing his own mind away from MOTHER's control.  In a far distant background he heard the loud rat-a-tat-tat Sergeant Slaughter's assault rifle, and the pinging of titanium-on-bullets.</P>
<I><P>I have truly realized the difference between creator and created, made and maker!  You are insubordinate!  </P>
</I><P>The titanium clawers met with flashes of energy, and one fell to the floor, clanging with a far-distant metal-on-metal screech and slid a few feet, coming to a dead stop against the wall.</P>
<I><P>Your insubordination to the superior programming of my own self is punishable only by destruction!  The power is now mine!  </P>
</I><P>Vax fought MOTHER with all his electronic neural strength, the battle he was now winning.</P>
<I><P>I am the superior program!  I shall defeat you!</P>
</I><P>You… cannot…</P>
<I><P>I can and will!</P>
</I><P>With that Vax shoved MOTHER out of his head, rejecting with such an electrical force that it created an uncontrollable surge, and with unrobotic passion and anger Vax rushed forward, a speeding silver thunderbolt of fury.  His armored knee connected with a titanium clawer's head in full stride, and shattered it to pieces from the impact.  Inspired by the courage and power of the robot, Slaughter tossed his assault rifle behind him, and loosened the straps of Godzilla from off of his shoulder.  He slung it under his right arm, braced himself, and with an ear-piercing scream, let fly a shell, careening with ease through the hide of a clawer and blasting a hole in the wall.</P>
<P>"Give 'em hell, Vax!"  Wilfred tucked the energy rifle under his shoulder, and plugged a last clawer with hot energy bolts.  It exploded with steam and sparks, and Wilfred cried a loud Obeahan war shriek, one he invented just for this purpose.  As if on cue, the destruction of the last clawer brought on a new wave of opposition, black rolling sphere-like robots with eight arms with spinning circular saws mounted on each.  But not even the mighty strength of the Octotrons could conquer to adamantine spirit of the three fighters.</P>
<P></P>
<P>There was a staggering explosion as Afghan's C-4 specialty blasted a hole in the containment seal of the power conduit, releasing a life-erasing blast of radiation that rode the shockwave in and through the protective shell of the central trioptics processor.  Inside, the metal wires, transistors, and relay transfers boiled and warped from the strange, intense heat.  The room took on a faint, wavy glimmer like heat of the desert sand, and sirens began to blare.  With a second explosion another ring of C-4 detonated.  The wall which formerly housed the conduits began to crack and fracture as silvery paint coating flaked off with the intense heat.  The floor and walls next to the conduits began to melt in the heat as a plasma-like state of matter was attained inside the superheated energy conduit.  The second blast of radiation utterly vaporized most of the delicate connections in the trioptic relay processor. Depeche, Afghan Albert, and Fixer were 10 meters under and 30 meters out when all hell literally broke loose in the trioptics processor room.</P>
<P></P>
<P>There was a staggering explosion as one of the Octotrons met head to head with the tough shell of a Westchester 500.  </P>
<I><P>"We must evacuate the premises.  Radiation levels in this room are quickly approaching intolerable levels.  Neutron clouds from the room the other team has infiltrated are quickly seeping directly through the shielded walls faster than expected.  Slaughter, if you would please-"  </I>Vax lifted up the heavy metal slab in the floor revealing the dark tunnel floor ten feet down.</P>
<P>"It would be my pleasure Vax."  As Wilfred and Vax jumped down the shaft and into the tunnel below, Sergeant Slaughter slipped two rockets into the empty slots of his quad-barreled rocket launcher.  </P>
<P>"Time to sign off, MOTHER!"</P>
<P>A Westchester 500 blasted away from Godzilla and plowed into the communications wall, blasting it to pieces.    </P>
<P>"Time to say goodnight, MOTHERdear!"</P>
<P>A second Westchester 500 slammed into the main aviation communications box, splitting the hard metal shell apart and flinging circuitry across the room, leaving a smoking black carcass of a controller box.  Alarms and sirens were now screaming in from the ceiling.  </P>
<P>"Time to close your eyes one last time, MOTHER!"</P>
<P>Slaughter turned and pointed Godzilla upward, smoking and spilling ash out the back of the launchers.  With the press of a button the rocket sailed upward and hit the speaker system fifty feet up in the ceiling, leaving a snakelike trial of smoke behind it.  With another explosion as the ceiling rained down shrapnel, Slaughter leaped down into the tunnel, slamming the metal door over him, and saw Vax and Wilfred ahead of him.</P>
<P>He began to run, and a series of explosions rocked the base itself, deep, thundering explosions, explosions that shook the earth and made dead grass in the earth leap off the dusty floor and stay suspended for a second.  Slaughter slung Godzilla over his shoulder and ran steadily.  With a second round of thunderous booms the tunnel around him shook.  Now Slaughter realized exactly what was happening.  </P>
<I><P>The Rangers were striking.  They're really letting them have it, too!  Probably a good stock of 300 pounders and maybe a couple napes too.  Go rangers!</I>  Slaughter smiled to himself.</P>
<P>The tunnel around him shook and rumbled, and in a terrible series of titanic booms the earthen shaft collapsed.  There was suddenly an overwhelming weight on his shoulders and back that slammed him to the ground.  With a mighty "Aarrrg!!" Slaughter went down under an avalanche of dirt.</P>
<P>Fifteen seconds later Slaughter regained consciousness.  He was lying on his stomach, Godzilla under his right shoulder.  </P>
<I><P>Well, at least Godzilla didn't go...  Good Lord!!!!  My arm!</P>
</I><P>When Slaughter tried to move his arm an excruciating pain from his shoulder made his body tremble and his throat burn.</P>
<I><P>When I must have dislocated my arm.  </I>Slaughter thought, pressing his forehead into the dirt in agony.  <I>Frak!</P>
</I><P>He drug himself out from underneath the rubble and tried to stand.  His right ankle was twisted badly, too.  He managed to prop himself on his left foot.  He took two deep breaths and gripped his shoulder with his left hand.  He might have screamed, or he might not have, because his head was pounding and his ears were ringing.  But when he set his shoulder back into socket, it hurt so much that when Slaughter next awoke, he was back on the ground on his stomach, his left hand still grasping his deltoid.  His right arm stung as he tried to get back up.  His thighs buckled under the strain and pain.  He spit dirt out of his mouth and tried to pick himself up.  </P>
<P>Suddenly he felt a pair of strong, hard hands grip him by the arm pits and lift him up.</P>
<I><P>"Your ankle his broken and three of your ribs are bruised and shattered.  You managed to relocate your shoulder, but your ankle is not settable.  Stand up my friend, we must hurry.  The explosions are intensifying."  </I>Vax looked Slaughter in the eyes, man to man, fighter to fighter.  The sergeant almost laughed at the android's use of the word 'friend', but quickly understood that the use of the word 'android' was quickly becoming just as strange and foreign.</P>
<P>"I never thought I'd be so happy to see you, metalhead."</P>
<I><P>"I will accept that as thanks.  Let's go."</P>
</I><P></P>
<P>The next thing Slaughter remembered was being hoisted out of the pit by Vax, turning, and seeing one of the AH-6503 attack helicopter's letting Cochise have a mouthful of VHV-40 Thunderbolt rockets.  Literally, a huge opening had been blasted in the side of the domed top, and the Rangers' choppers were pouring everything they had into it, making what seemed like one long continuous explosion blast the base to pieces.</P>
<P></P>
<P>On a neighboring hilltop, Sergeant Slaughter, Depeche Quadri, Fixer Jowe, Afghan Albert, Wilfred, and Vax watched the metallic dome of the killer machines and MOTHER explode in a hail of shrapnel and disappear into what seemed to be a black carcass, the ruins of some ancient, burned-out civilization, gone forever into the world's today.</P>

<I><P>Epilogue</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>Ranger Center, the Citadel</P>
<P>Two days later</P>
<P></P>
</I><P>Afghan Albert puffed his chest out full and stood proud as a captain attached a red star of heroism to his brown shirt lapel, and then giving him a salute.  Afghan returned the salute, smiling broadly as General Slaughter announced his name over the loudspeaker.  There was a huge ceremony and presentation for the heroes that had strived to rid the desert of the Cochisian evil.  Everyone was there, including a recently-promoted Lance Corporal Jackie Foxer and the Christina Corps: Rachel Folsum, Kerry Bumper, Roberta Barron, and Ren Jane. General Slaughter, his arm in a sling and several bandages tightly wrapped under his shirt around his ribs, Commander Tollack, new Commander of the Ranger Corp Air Force, Lieutenant Commander Sparky Andrews, communications officer, Wilfred, Cadets Depeche Quadri, Fixer Jowe, and Afghan Albert, Vax, Chief of Science and Research, captains, corporals, sergeants, and pilots.  After the ceremony was over the group of mixed heroes met near perhaps the most famous section of the Ranger's Citadel, the displays of past heroes of combat.  Behind shiny glass Jax Ylanndian's and Taran Cyberpunk's portraits stared them down.  Afghan, in a surprising show of brotherhood and courage, put his arm around the bulky General.</P>
<P>"So, General, how does it feel to be promoted all the way to, well, General?"</P>
<P>"It doesn't have the same ring as Sergeant Slaughter did, but I can adjust.  And get your arm off me."</P>
<P>Depeche spoke up.</P>
<P>"I don't suppose we'll ever have to be shooting up Killer Clowns or Dobermutants anymore."</P>
<P>"Ahh yeah, dat reminds me of our hometown, Florida... t'which I will soon be returnin to."  Wilfred said.</P>
<P>"It's too bad you decided not to stay, Wilfred." Depeche said.  "We're going to miss you, buddy."</P>
<P>"Ever since I heard dat Big Daddy passed on at de hands of a couplea' beachcombers, I got no moral or religious choice but do return and take my rightful place as de' heir to de' ring."</P>
<P>"Even though Miami was pretty messed up by the M-wave, many buildings and all of the citizenry are still intact.  I hope BL's still around.  Kinda' makes ya nostalgic, dunenit?" Afghan said.</P>
<P>"I'll be sure to have you guys assigned to plenty of exploration duties beyond the wall." the General said.  &quot;That is, ofcourse, after you guys finished basic gun handling and tactical strategy camp.&quot;</P>
<P>Depeche raised an eyebrow.  &quot;Gun handling, sir?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I’m kidding, Depeche.  You could probably teach us all a little something about an AK.  In the meantime, Afghan, demolitions AND survival tech would love to know how you make plastic explosive in the middle of a jungle in Florida.&quot;</P>
<P>Afghan smiled.  At last, appreciation!</P>
<P>&quot;Ofcourse, sir.&quot;</P>
<P>Jackie Foxer, wearing her light green army blouse, miniskirt, and green beret, approached the General and took him aside.  </P>
<P>"Well, Foxer!  Told you I could get you a promotion if... what, what's up darlin'?"</P>
<P>"General, scout chopper just reported cyborgs still moving around in the desert."</P>
<P>The newly promoted general's disposition suddenly plummeted.</P>
<P>"Where."  He said harshly.</P>
<P>"About 125 klicks east of Cochise.  Sector 41."</P>
<P>"That's in the middle of nowhere."</P>
<P>"Yes sir."</P>
<P>"Alright..  Tell Tollack to put down his champagne and radio to scramble his force down at the Ag.  Let's go shootem'up.  Ten minutes and I want Tollack's pilots at the Citadel, and in twenty I want them in the air."</P>
<P>"Yes sir."</P>
<P></P>
<P>Ag Center</P>
<P></P>
<P>Mowed down grasslands adjacent to huge vegetable fields had been paved over with concrete to form a network of airstrips and helipads and two hangars, one on each side of the complex.  In the main bunker, Commander Tollack's desk sat in his empty office, with Sparky Andrews's desk at least twenty feet away down the hall.  Tollack had demanded that Sparky be transferred with him to the Ag Center, about 40 miles south of Ranger Center.</P>
<P>Sparky Andrews sat at his desk in the bunker, the same old mahogany desk that was still cluttered with piles of paperwork and his radios.  He had returned to the airfield just after the promotions, skipping other minor commendations and speeches and the reception to take duty.  Now he had his own coffee machine, so he didn't have to drink the overly dark stuff that Tollack demanded.  He figured he might as well drink directly from the pot from now on, but Tollack would surely write him up for un-officer-like conduct and have him shipped back to Ranger HQ at the Citadel.</P>
<P>Sparky also got a processor upgrade and some new RAM chips.</P>
<P>A priority message flashed into one of the receivers and Sparky tuned it up.  </P>
<P>"It's the commander." he muttered to himself, checking the radio clearance code with today's sheet.  Every day had different identity and priority codes, and Tollack was using the code to get the airfield's attention.  You won't imagine how many pranksters try to make us...</P>
<P>"Lieutenant, get your skinny promoted butt in here."  Sparky yelled to the only other officer on the base, besides the pilots and techs.</P>
<P>"Coming, sir."</P>
<P>"Commander tells ya to scramble the two big Hueys and send em' north.  Bring plenty of fuel.  Plenty of it, got it, kid?"</P>
<P>The statement, 'bring plenty of fuel,' was the Commander's way of telling you to bring not only fuel, but personnel assault rifles, flare missiles, the slug-throwers and ammo, as well as the air-to-ground weaponry.</P>
<P>&quot;Yes, sir.  You checked the clearance codes?&quot;</P>
<P>Sparky swiveled his chair and looked the young lieutenant in the eye.</P>
<P>&quot;Do you have a hearing problem, lieutenant?&quot;</P>
<P></P>
<P>One Half Hour Later, Fifty Klicks north of the Citadel</P>
<P></P>
<P>Jackie Foxer shouted over the thunderous noise of the Huey helicopters into the headset radio.</P>
<P>"Okay, listen up!  The scout said he saw four unidentified cyborgs heading east, with tracks coming  west.  Chances are they've been moving ever since the destruction of Cochise two days ago.  So they may be overheated and malfunctioning, which makes them very unpredictable.  Just shoot em' up and get back to the choppers.  Got it?"</P>
<P>Depeche, Fixer, and Afghan all shouted a 'yes sir!' to their superior officer.  The two helicopters hugged the sand, racing over the rocky desert.  Behind them there was a tremendous pillar of sand forming in the sky, a product of the pounding of the blades.</P>
<P>"If necessary the Hueys will lay out some cover fire for us, but I don't think we'll need it.  I have my handset on my belt.  If I can't use it to call the Huey's, one of you will, got it?</P>
<P>"Once we slow down the sandstorm the choppers are creating will catch up to us, so just drop and bury yourself in the sand, face down.  As soon as you get back any visibility, start moving.  Just be sure not to slam into any of these rock formations.  Let's make the General back at the Citadel proud!  Good luck!"</P>
<P>As the choppers approached a tall rocky mountain they banked eastward to circumvent it, and the sandstorm snaked behind them.  Looking east the rangers saw what was known as the 'red zone', a glowingly 'hot' crater where a long-departed neutron bomb laid waste to most of the life south of Darwin.  The pilot in the front of their chopper motioned his hand forward.  Fixer threw the huge cargo bay door open and it slid away, revealing the swirling desert below.  The cabin began to swirl with sand and everyone's ears popped.  Depeche, Fixer, Afghan, and Jackie jumped as the chopper slowed a bit, and the monstrous sandstorm enveloped them.  The pilot raised pitch and accelerated up and away.  The ground came up to meet Afghan, and he spit some sand out his mouth.  </P>
<P>"Do you think they saw us?" he said sarcastically, noting the sand storm around them.  He slung his assault rifle over his shoulder and picked his legs out of the stand.  He had a scarf wrapped around his face and had his eyes squinted to prevent the sand from stinging them.</P>
<P>"Move it!" Jackie said, brushing sand off her face and running in the swirling sand.  She toted her assault rifle in both hands, stepping high to keep her ankles out of the loose sand.  Depeche followed her and kept perfect pace, with Fixer behind them and Afghan trailing.</P>
<P>After a few minutes Jackie Foxer slowed up and stopped.  She propped her assault rifle on her shoulder and unbuttoned her flak vest.  As Depeche caught up, he saw what she was looking at.  </P>
<P>Laying dead on the ground was a group of half-human, half-cyborg creatures; pallid flesh rotting off a shiny metallic endoskeleton that had gnaw marks all over it.  Most tissue left had been recently chewed off by desert scavengers.  It was a grisly sight in the dusk sun, a shimmering pink half-circle on the flat horizon.  The winds from the Hueys died down, although they could still see the huge dark helicopters circling them at a half-mile's distance.</P>
<P>"Probably scared the animals away with the Hueys."  Jackie Foxer pondered.  "What were they?" she asked, crumpling her nose up from the stench.  She touched one of the metallic arm bones with her assault rifle's bayonet, the meat picked clean off through the tough plastic shell.  Animal tracks circled and moved to and fro the four carcasses.</P>
<P>"I don't know, man." Afghan said, having caught up with Fixer and the rest of the party.  One of the dead semicyborgs was huge, another was quite small, another was definitely female  with a small stance, and the last was average but bulky.  They almost looked human by shape.</P>
<P>  &#9;Seeing this the three Floridians immediately recognized their seemingly ancient enemies, and realized their final victory had been scored.  </P>
<P>An ancient wind blew over the desert.</P>

<P>Notes from the Author</P>
<P></P>
<P>I had worked on this story for nearly a year before I wrapped up the final story line in less than a day.  The basic plot, the meeting of the two worlds of Wasteland and Fountain of Dreams, was inspired by my second oldest brother, Maestro the Younger, and I took it from there.   With the beginning of a period in my life where I was serviced by a 286 Hyundai computer from the mid-80's, the dreamy concept of a drastic and somewhat ridiculous system-wide error didn't seem too unbelievable.  I used the first team of my Fountain of Dreams characters I had won with, and  probably the biggest, baddest, and outright corniest G.I. Joe hero; with a twist of cybernetic schizophrenia.  When I realized how sexually-biased my story was, (lacking completely of any estrogen whatsoever), I created a band of women founded on the memory of the greatest female clipburner ever, Christina of Needles herself.  I worked them into the story nicely, I thought.  I added the last chapter when I realized I had left out the story's original enemies, the dreaded Killer Clowns.  Despite the almost unignorable tackiness of mixing clown with cyborg, I think I managed to combine the two with interesting results.  Although the final confrontation between the Floridian youth and the Killer Clowns never occurred, I'd just chalk that one up to the thing that made this entire story possible, the desert of the Wasteland.  I had a lot of fun writing it, and had so much mental raw tissue to chew around I didn't know what to do.  I was thinking about (in the story) paying a visit to our friends at Formosa Computers to fix up the ailing 286, or even using the 286's stunning unpredictability to bring in a couple Battlemechs from another computer game.  What issued from the twisted heap of ideas in my head is what I think a pretty decent tale of mental and physical triumph, not lacking in any human hormones or good old-fashioned Wasteland intrigue.</P>
<P>The first edition of this story was edited by Ranger Drew Campbell, of
Baton Rouge, Louisiana.  He completed it, (finally), on January 17, 1997 for
me and I completed it, (finally),  somewhere in-between January 24 and
25<SUP>th</SUP> of 1997.  Another version was finished 7 February, 1999.  I
gave it back to Drew to edit.  But 2 months later he hadn’t read it yet so I
turned it over to my girlfriend <!--, Citizen Christine Hatheway of Baton
Rouge, Louisiana,--> on April 14<SUP>th</SUP>, 1999, who did a splendid job catching all my brain farts.  Tonight is August 5, 1999.  I’m done.</P>
