by V</h4>

"Gun Wolf! Shoot with your ears and mind!" the Indian drill instructor yelled.
Gun Wolf, the young Indian who’s of Commanche ancestry,
was laying on his stomach with his old Springfield rifle, blind-folded.
Gun Wolf was a pretty strong Indian, and a fast one too.
His long black hair was fixed into a thick braid that ran down his back,
until it halted between his shoulder blades. He was well built, full of
muscle and hardly an ounce of fat on him. He was clad in a pair of
soft-black raw-hide pants, a pair of combat mocassins, and had
several large crow feathers in his hair.
<P>
A single bell was about fifty yards away, suspended by a string that was
hanging across a tree branch. Another Indian was jingling the bell.
<P>
"How? I just keep blowing away wild-life and innocent bystanders!
Can we practice something else?" Gun Wolf complained, blindly working the
bolt-action to the gun. 
<P>
"No! We’re not going to leave until you hit the bell!" the warrior barked.
Gun Wolf’s adopted tribe was more like the old United States Marine Corps,
back when America still had a government. The only difference between the
Black Raven clan and the USMC was that the USMC wore uniforms,
and lived in military bases. Gun Wolf sighed, took a deep breath,
and concentrated on the jingling.
<P>
He could visualize the bell... rattling and where the noise was coming from.
He also visualized himself, taking aim... where the bell would be.
The bullet firing to meet the bell. He squeezed the trigger,
a shot cracking the air. The bell kept jingling.
Gun Wolf was pretty annoyed now.
<P>
"Gun Wolf! Try again! If you don’t make it this time, then you’ll be forced to
weave mesh armor with the women for the rest of your days with the Black
Ravens!" the warrior instructor barked.
<P>
"Fine!" Gun Wolf snarled back in anger. His furied hands worked the bolt
action and once more he zeroed in on the bell. The noise... the noise’s
source... where to aim... where to place the bullet. He fired again,
the crack of the gun drowning out the bell’s ringing.
A clang of metal was heard. Gun Wolf raised an eyebrow as he noted the bell
stopped chattering.
<P>
"Nice... you’ve killed the bell. That’s it for today’s lesson." 
<P>
Gun Wolf yanked the blindfold from his face, getting to his feet.
He brushed himself off as he walked back to the village,
away from the firing range. Taking a short-cut through the desert,
he could make it in half the time....
<P>
<P>
He finally arrived in the village, at dusk.
The place was made mostly of canvas tents, with a large fire pit in the middle.
The place smelled of manure, since the horse coral was in the northeast.
Killja’s shop, a.k.a. the village armory, was to the west of the fire pit.
He sold a nice variety of weapons and armor there. There was a smoke-house,
where food was stored, and the doctor’s "office". The rest of the tents were
just where people lived, except for the highly-decorated tent with the two
armed gaurds outside, which was the chief’s tent. 
<P>
Gun Wolf walked over to his tent, unzipping the flap. He folded it open,
pinning it to the side with the little snap-button. The Indian lived alone,
and was an outsider in the desert village. After he had arrived,
about a month ago with amnesia, they couldn’t really accept him,
because he was too violent. His skill with guns and agressive nature in
combat earned him the name ‘GUN WOLF’.
<P>
"Gun Wolf!" a female voice called from behind him. Gun Wolf turned around,
looking at the speaker. It was Koh, Gun Wolf’s lady friend.
She was gorgeous in Gun Wolf’s mind, but he took the logical path and didn’t
tell her his feelings. She had a slender hour-glass figure, and had the tan
that a lot of Indians have. Her hair was braided in three thick braids that
went down her back, and she was wearing a cotton dress, and no shoes.
Her ears were pierced from top to bottom with silver loops.
<P>
"Hi, Koh." Gun Wolf replied, forgetting about his tent. "What’s going on?"
<P>
"Nothing really. There’s a rumor that an army of robots is coming to wipe
us out in the west, but I doubt that." Koh smiled. For a "primitive savage,"
she certainly kept good dental hygene. 
<P>
"Really?" Gun Wolf replied, scratching an itch on his nose.
<P>
"Maybe. There’s also another rumor that the Chief found a device that can
stop them, but it's missing a piece." Koh added.
<P>
"Heh... a lot of rumors all of a sudden." Gun Wolf chuckled as he started
to walk into his tent. Koh was annoyed at his lack of interest,
since she secretely adored him, and didn’t care about the fact he put three
warriors in the doctor’s care. What mattered was that he really was a good
person deep down.
<P>
"Well, bye!" she cheered as she departed. 
<P>
Gun Wolf laid down on his brahma skin, which was a comfortable bed.
He closed his eyes, dreaming about Koh getting captured by raiders and him
rescuing her. He could picture himself stealthilly dropping in on the fiends,
fighting them off and slaying them, then cutting her bonds and have her
slender arms wrap around him. Then they would---
<P>
The town emergency bell rang. Gun Wolf’s eyes snapped open as he sat up
and scrambled to his feet. As he climbed from his tent, he realized he must’ve
been day-dreaming for awhile, since it was already dark out.
Running over to where the town usually assembled, the fire pit,
he joined the crowd and took a seat next to Koh.
<P>
The fire’s light danced on their faces as the chief walked into view.
He was a tall, old man. His wrinkled and weathered face had the look of
intellegence, and his white-and-gray hair was hidden in his head dress of
glossy black raven feathers. His long robe was adorn with shiny black beads
and even more feathers. The fire light flickered, gracing his withered
features as he stood in front of the town of about thirty-two people.
<P>
"I wonder if he’ll confirm the rumors...." Koh whispered to Gun Wolf.
Gun Wolf nodded and nudged her as the Chief began to speak.
<P>
"Rumors have been of metal demons to the west.... Those rumors are true,"
the Chief spoke. His voice was scratchy, like gravel in his throat was
rustling against his vocal cords. The town began murmuring until he waved
them to silence. "Yes, I do have the device to stop them. It is a 
machine that emits electro-magnetic pulses in a circle... shutting down the
robotic devils when they enter our range. It is missing a critical part
though... the fusion cell."
<P>
"What will we do?" a voice called out from the crowd.
<P>
"We must send someone to get the part before the metal demons overtake us.
We will pick someone later... meeting ajourned," the Chief responded and
turned his back on the crowd, disappearing into the darkness that the fire
pit couldn’t penetrate.
<P>
"Damn.... I wonder who they’ll send out." Koh whispered to Gun Wolf.
Koh was problably the only one that talked to him, besides Killja.
<P>
"I dunno... I’m going to get some sleep. You should do the same."
Gun Wolf nodded to Koh, prodding her with his elbow playingly.
<P>
"Alright...see you tomorrow morning."
<P>
<P align="center">* * * *</p>
<P>
Gun Wolf awoke, not by will, but by someone shaking him. His eyes flickered
open and he was staring at a burly warrior. Gun Wolf wiped his eyes and sat up.
<P>
"Yes? Why’ve you entered my tent?" he inquired, rubbing the back of his neck.
<P>
"The Chief wants to see you." the man said sternly.
<P>
"Hmm...ok. Mind if I get some pants on first?"
<P>
"Be quick about it." the man grunted as Gun Wolf grabbed a pair of black
raw-hide pants and slid them on, as well as his tough combat mocassins.
He got to his feet and the gaurd took him to the Chief’s tent.
<P>
The tent was furnished lavishly, with animal skins on the walls,
stacks of brahma skin that served as couches, and a chair carved from stone.
The one thing that caught Gun Wolf’s eye was the large machine sitting
in the corner. The Chief was sitting in his stone-carved throne.
<P>
Gun Wolf kneeled, bowing to his adopted leader.
<P>
"Rise, Gun Wolf. We know you are new to us, but we know that you are very
skilled in combat and scavenging things."
<P>
"Yes?" Gun Wolf said as he sat up. 
<P>
"Well, I want you to find the fusion cell. Without it, we’re doomed.
And the village has seen your skills in weapons, so I believe you’re best
equipped for this mission since there’s problably going to to have combat
involved."
<P>
"Well, as much as I don’t want to do this, I’ll accept the task."
Gun Wolf sighed as he thought of Koh being killed by the machines
and the village being burnt to the ground.
<P>
"Thank you, Gun Wolf. Talk to Killja... take any weapon from the store
and some supplies. Good luck, and have a safe journey." 
<P>
<P align="center">* * * *</p>
<P>
Gun Wolf left the tent and went to Killja’s the gunsmith’s shop. The store
was small, but Killja had made due with what space he had. A few rifles
were on the shelves, boxes of ammunition were on a counter, and various
pistols and submachine-guns were on a table. Armor was hanging on the walls,
and there was the counter with the large ancient Browning thirty-caliber
machine-gun that Killja liked to use on shoplifters. Killja, the short moogle,
was standing on the counter and leaning against the Browning.
<P>
"Well... lucky you. Seems you got chosen to get the fusion cell. Any how,
take whatever you need... but don’t ram-sack my store, or I’ll ventilate you."
Killja spoke in a semi-squeaky voice. 
<P>
"Hmm... alright. I guess I’ll take this... this... a few clips of that...
and three of these grenades." Gun Wolf said as he grabbed an Uzi Mark 27 SMG
nine-millimeter submachine-gun, a jet-black Browning M1911A1,
three nine-millimeter clips for his UZI and two fourty-five caliber clips,
and the three grenades with the faded red letters "USMC" on the side.
<P>
"Those are good guns, but The Chief told me to give you these.
They’ll help you along your way." Killja squeaked as he spit out two objects.
The first one was a long, shiny black cylindrical item and the second was a
smaller cylinder with a little red lense and a wire hanging out of the back.
"Silencer... it makes the gunshots a tad quieter.
Only problem is that its chambered for fourty-five only, so you can only
use it on your pistol. Second one is a laser dot. You hook it up to the bottom
of the gun and put the wire on the handle. When you touch this little thingy
it’ll activate it, making a little red dot. Useful for aiming better."
<P>
"Thanks. I’ll be needing some armor... you have any?"
<P>
"‘Fraid not.... I do have a thick leather jacket, though.
Might help against some attacks. Better than nothing."
<P>
"It’ll work." Gun Wolf nodded as the moogle tossed him the black leather
jacket. He slid the jacket on; it was a loose fit. "I’ll be going now.
I apreciate your help."
<P>
"No problem."
<P>
<P align="center">* * * *</p>
<P>
Gun Wolf left the village, sporting the silenced M1911A1 and the Uzi
with the laser-dot on it. He held the SMG with one hand as he walked out
into the wasteland. 
<P>
After two days of travelling east, he came across a long river.
He stood there for a moment, thinking about how he could get by it.
The rushing greenish water was a torrent waiting to suck him in. Gun Wolf 
took a deep breath and jumped in. The current pulled the Indian,
but he kept swimming and reached the other end, soaked and gasping for air.
<P>
"Damn.... Hope my guns are okay." he muttered as he got to his feet.
<P>
There was a small town south, so he headed there.
<P>
<P align="center">* * * *</p>
<P>
Gun Wolf arrived in Quartz, pretty tired. There was a large building with a
sign reading <B><FONT FACE="Copperplate Gothic Light" SIZE=2>"SCOTT’S
BAR"</B></FONT> in front of him. He casually entered the bar and looked around.
<P>
The place was huge, full of tables and music. There were people sitting
at the tables or the long bar that stretched down the west end of the bar.
To the east was a stage, where women were dancing around naked and greasy
punks waving twenties at the dancers. Two bouncers were at the foot of the
stage, clutching Louisville Sluggers with nails sticking out of them.
Two psuedo-military guys sat at one table, their large guns sitting
next to them. They kind of stood out, and the patches on their sleeves read
"Desert Ranger". They seemed to be discussing something about an assault
rifle for sale and how they could find a better weapon than throwing spikes.
<P>
A New Waver walked up behind one of the Rangers, the one with the spikey
black hair and ballistic-goggles on his forehead. A switchblade went into the
Ranger’s back and he grit his teeth in pain. The punk laughed but was cut
short when a ninja guy sent the New Waver’s brains all over the place as he
triggered a burst from his Uzi into his forehead.
<P>
"Stupid punks..." the spikey-headed one muttered in a low voice as he
yanked the knife from his back. "Thank God for kevlar vests...."
<P>
"You alright Valentine?" the ninja Asian one said as he lowered his smoking
Uzi. He spoke with a thick accent.
<P>
"Yeah...don’t worry about it, Yukoza. Where’s Creed and Gamma?"
<P>
"Don’t know. Maybe in the bathroom."
<P>
Gun Wolf walked over to the two soldier-esque guys and stood by their table.
The one called Valentine looked up at him.
<P>
"You need something?" he spoke.
<P>
"I was wondering if you could tell me where I could find a fusion cell."
Gun Wolf replied. He was kind of nervous, since the Ranger had a large
submachine-gun sitting next to his bottle of liquor.
<P>
"Heh.... I wouldn’t know. There’s nothing that hi-tech around here.... You
might want to try Las Vegas... but that place is a death-trap. Robots roaming
around and maiming the hell out of everything." he replied, absently pouring
another shot glass of whiskey.
<P>
"Well, thanks. Where’s Las Vegas?"
<P>
"Northwest of here. But I wouldn’t go up there until you had some better
armor and weapons, or you’ll problably wind up a smoking carcass laying
in the street." Valentine nodded as he downed the whiskey.
Yukoza just sat there, in a ninja meditation.
<P>
"Where could I find some better gear?"
<P>
"Well, there’s the Quartz Emporium to the west of here... and there’s some
guys playing poker in the southwest part of the bar,
by the back entrance. They might have some stuff... if you could use that Uzi
to... umm... persuade them." 
<P>
"Thanks...I didn’t get your names."
<P>
"I’m Valentine Soprano... this is Yukoza, the Kung Fu bad-ass ninja.
You are...?"
<P>
"Gun Wolf. I need to find a fusion cell or my village is screwed."
<P>
"Sounds bad... we’ve been sent to seek out and destroy the source of the
robot threat. No luck so far, though. We’re just solving this hole’s
problems first."
<P>
"Well, nice meeting you. Maybe if we run into each other again I could help
you guys out with that robot problem."
<P>
"Heh....  That’d be cool. Later!" 
<P>
"Good bye." Yukoza finally spoke up.
<P>
Gun Wolf felt relieved. He had gotten a lead on where to go and 
where to get some better gear. In his mind, he thought of how he might
actually be accepted by the Black Ravens if the fusion cell was found.
He headed towards the poker players and whipped out his M1911A1 with the long
black silencer on it. 
<P>
The first poker player had his back turned to him. He was problably
the dealer, since he was giving out the cards. The other guys were in a
circle around a small table. Raising the pistol, he took careful aim.
<P>
<FONT FACE="AdLib BT" SIZE=2><P>*FIP!* *FIP!*</FONT>
<P>
Two fourty-five caliber bullets hit the dealer in the back.
He fell over, writhing on the floor. The dealer was hemoragging and in
convulsions. The punks looked up and drew their weapons as they kicked
over the table. There were three of them, two were packing VP91Z
9mm pistols and the other one was clutching an M-19 single-shot rifle. 
<P>
<FONT FACE="AdLib BT" SIZE=2><P>*FIP!*</FONT>
<P>
The rifleman’s gun flew out of his hands as a .45 slug caught him in the chest.
The round had pierced his heart and sent him slumping against the wall and
sliding down, leaving a thin trail of blood. The punks however,
opened fire at Gun Wolf. The Indian did a football manuever and spun
around to his left as two bullets flew past him.
A nine-millimeter bullet caught him in the gut, sending him doubling over.
<P>
Gun Wolf grit his teeth in pain as he clutched the burning wound. The
shooter walked over to Gun Wolf and pressed the gun to his temple.
<P>
"Heheheh... this was a private game... and you’re not invit--" the
man was cut off by something. Gun Wolf looked up to see the man crumple
to the floor with a throwing spike in his forehead. He looked around for the
assassin that had saved him, but he couldn’t find anyone. The second punk
started looking around as well, pointing his pistol at the ceiling and walls.
<P>
"KAAAA-YAHH!!!" an Asian voice yelled and the punk’s head exploded.
The body fell over to its knees to reveal Yukoza, dressed in his ninja
garb with a grey kevlar vest over it, with his hand covered in blood.
"You should learn to use more stealth in your kills. Silencer was good touch,
but you’re still wounded. Ninja know no pain."
<P>
"G--gah.... Thanks, Yukoza..." Gun Wolf murmured before he passed out.
<P>
<P align="center">* * * *</p>
<P>
Gun Wolf awoke in the infirmary, with a large bandage on his stomach.
He could hear the rustle of peoples’ clothing in the background,
which meant somebody was nearby. Attempting to sit up was a difficult task,
since the slightest abdominal movement sent stabbing pains through his
entire torso. The doctor walked into the room, looking over Gun Wolf.
<P>
"Well...you certainly were lucky. Group of Desert Rangers brought you in
and paid for the medical bills. The bullet’s out of your stomach,
and you’ll live." the doctor said, setting down his clipboard.
<P>
"Agh.... How long do you think it’ll be until I can leave?" Gun Wolf
groaned in reply, looking at the bandage on his six-pack.
<P>
"Hmm... about two or three days, at the most. Get some rest... you’ll feel
better in the morning. I’ll use some stim-paks on you so you’ll heal faster
while you sleep." the doctor implied and picked up his clipboard.
He jotted something down, and left. Gun Wolf took his advice and fell asleep.
<P>
<P align="center">* * * *</p>
<P>
The next morning, he felt great. He sat up, climbed out of the bed,
and put his gear back on. As he slid the shoulder-holster containing his
silenced fourty-five, a voice called behind him.
<P>
"Heh... looks like you got busted up." a somewhat familiar voice laughed.
Gun Wolf turned around to see the spikey-headed Valentine.
He never bothered to examine the Desert Ranger until now.
<P>
Valentine was about six-two, maybe six-four if you counted his hair.
He wore an old outfit of black leather, a bandolier containing a few
grenades and a VP91Z nine-millimeter automatic, biker boots, a gun-belt
containing an Uzi Mark 27 and three clips of nine-millimeter slugs,
fingerless gloves, some ballistic goggles that were mainly for looks
on his head and held up his anime-like black hair, and a basic-issue grey
kevlar flakk vest with a skull-and-crossbones pin in it. He had a thin figure,
and wasn’t really muscular. Strapped to his back was a small ALICE
pack and a LAW-Rocket. He slightly resembled an Italian Guy Fawkner,
but not really.
<P>
"Oh...Valentine, right?" Gun Wolf nodded as he picked up his leather jacket.
<P>
"Right." he smirked.
<P>
"Thanks for paying the doctor’s bill. I apreciate it, since I don’t have any
money."
<P>
"Thank Yukoza. He’s the one who dragged you here and used his share of the
cash to patch you up."
<P>
"Well, tell him I said I apreciate his help when you see him."
<P>
"I will. Oh yeah... by the way, here’s a little item you’ll need in your
travels. Alot better than that shitty leather jacket."
Valentine said as he pulled a light-grey kevlar vest from his ALICE pack.
He threw it at Gun Wolf, landing it in his stomach.
"Thank me later. Any how, me and the squad are going to Las Vegas.
There’s some crap goin’ on there and Brygo needs our help.
But there’s also some other troubles in here... gang problem.
I figure we’ll mop up Ugly and be on our way."
<P>
"Who’s Brygo?"
<P>
"Don’t worry about it. If we cross paths again, I’d be more than happy
to recruit you. In fact, I’m problably going to any way."
<P>
"Recruit me? Into what?"
<P>
"The Desert Rangers, you mook. Consider yourself a Private from this point on.
Me and the guys have gotta go, though. Good luck.... I’ll see you in Vegas,
if you live long enough to make it there." Valentine said as he walked
out the door.
<P>
Gun Wolf shrugged and strapped on the flakk vest. It was a nice fit,
and was comfortable. He zipped it up and picked up his stuff.
As he left the hospital, two bikers stepped up in front of him.
<P>
"Heey, Freshmeat!" the first leather-clad beer gut
with legs said as he pulled out a heavy metal chain. 
<P>
"Cut the shit, Bobby Lee! TIME TO DIE!!" the second one said. He was a tad
overweight, but not as fat as the portly one with the chain.
The biker whipped out his knife and lunged.
<P>
"Poor choice in attack..." Gun Wolf growled as he produced the laser-sighted
Uzi he had concealed under his flakk vest. A red dot the size of a dime
appeared on the fat-ass biker’s stomach before a three-shot burst tore it open.
The second one with the knife was sprayed with gore as his tubby friend’s
intestines exploded like a twelve-pack of blood sausages. 
<P>
"AAAIE! YOU KILLED BOBBY LEE!!" the other biker screamed as he turned tail
and ran. Gun Wolf’s eyes narrowed as he pulled the silent M1911A1 .45
automatic from his shoulder-holster and levelled it at the fleeing attacker. 
<P>
<FONT FACE="AdLib BT" SIZE=2>*FIP!* *FIP!* *FIP!* *FIP!* *FIP!* *FIP!*
*FIP!*</FONT>
<P>
He emptied the magazine into the coward’s spine.
Blood sprayed in a red mist from the wounds like perfume does from an atomizer.
The biker fell over with seven smoking (and bleeding) holes in his back.
<P>
<I>Damn.... I didn’t even think about doing that. It was just a reflex...</I>
Gun Wolf thought to himself as he pressed the clip release,
letting the empty seven-shot clip clatter to the road.
He pulled out the only one left in his belt and clapped it into the sidearm.
Deciding to use the M1911A1 as a back-up piece, he came to the conclusion
that the Uzi was much better for all-out attacks since it held fourty
bullets per clip. If he could just get ahold of a MAC-17,
he could put the silencer and the laser-sight on it, and it’d eliminate having
to carry two kinds of ammunition. Kind of like Valentine packing the Uzi Mark
27 and the VP91Z. 
<P>
Gun Wolf casually lowered the UZI to his side and went into the Quartz
Emporium. He opened the door, and entered.
<P>
The Emporium was a pretty big store, with several large counters and tables.
There were rifles and clips on one table, pistols and small-arms bullets on
another, and various supplies like Geiger counters, canteens, ropes, books,
jewelry, and some other goodies. Gun Wolf walked over to the clerk,
pulling out his pistol and unscrewing the silencer.
He put it down on the counter.
<P>
"How much can get for this?"
<P>
"Hundred an’ fifty."
<P>
"Deal."
<P>
"I need some nine-millimeter clips. How much are those?"
<P>
"Thirty bucks a clip."
<P>
"Alright. I’ll take one fourty-shot."
<P>
Gun Wolf left the shop, tucking his left-over money down his kevlar
vest pocket and sliding the long, sleek nine-millimeter clip into his belt,
next to the others.  That made four to spare. He figured he had a nice amount
of ammunition to last him a while... so he might stand a chance in Las Vegas.
Hopefully a submachine-gun and one-hundred-and-sixty bullets
(not counting the thirty-seven bullets he had left in the clip already)
would be enough to survive. So he left for Vegas....
<P>
<P align="center">* * * *</p>
<P>
Valentine was right. This place was a war zone. There were robotic tanks
rolling around every half-an-hour or so. Cyborg commandoes sat around smoking
cigarettes in one corner of town. Land-mines threatened to blow off your legs
if you didn’t watch out. The urban decay of the city was somewhat spread out.
Most of the buildings were worn away, full of garbage.
Others were in good condition, and well, the ones in the center of town were
gaurded by the vicious MARK-7 SCORPITRON. 
<P>
Gun Wolf sat crouched in a nasty old building, clutching his Uzi at the ready.
He had three clips left, since he used the other thirty-seven slugs on a group
of Warriod Mark I’s down the road. The rumbling of tanks was heard as a
group of tanks rolled past the old building. The old sign labelled
"Mayfield Cleaners" fell off, clattering to the dirt.
Gun Wolf ducked behind the door, holding his breath. He prayed to the High
Spirits for their protection if the tanks spotted him. The rumbling passed,
until an audible bang as heard. Gun Wolf peeked his head out,
his Uzi held with both hands, and scanned the area.
The tanks had rolled right over a patch of landmines. They were all torn up,
smoking and blasted apart. They certainly didn’t make mechanized assault
vehicles like they used to. 
<P>
Sensing it was safe, Gun Wolf stalked out from the building,
holding his trusty submachine-gun with one hand as he ran across the street,
by this huge building. The enormous building had a few large banners with a
strange simbol.... Gun Wolf thought he’d seen one of those on a large barrel
labelled "NUCLEAR WASTE".
<P>
"Show yourself, stranger." a voice called from behind a large door.
Gun Wolf turned around to see the barrel of an assault rifle pointing at him
from a slot in the door. He stepped to his left. 
<P>
"Ahh... you must be with that group of Rangers. Go on in....  They’re trying
to find Max in the sewers. They went to try to take out that huge scorpion
in town square, so they could get ahold of Faran Brygo.
Good luck, if you’re going to go help them."
<P>
"Thanks..." Gun Wolf nodded and took off running towards the center of the city.
<P>
<P align="center">* * * *</p>
<P>
"VALENTINE! YUKOZA!" Gun Wolf yelled as he ran to the scene.
He took a few seconds to scan the area.
<P>
Valentine was crouched behind the corner of a building, struggling with a
jammed M1989A1 NATO assault rifle. He had changed his armor,
since he’d last seen him. He was clad in a kevlar suit now, and still had his
Uzi Mark 27 in his gun belt. Yukoza was pressed up against the side of a brick
building, wearing a kevlar suit with his ninja mask on.
A strange-looking rifle carbine was in his hand. There was a weird bald guy
with a third eye in the middle of his forehead wearing an armored radiation
suit,clutching a MAC-17 .45 SMG, running across the street with someone
following him. The other guy had bright green hair, wore a few bandoliers
full of bullets, and was clutching a mean-looking rocket launcher,
labelled RPG-7. His armor consisted of a black kevlar suit as well.
In the center of the town was the gargantuan robotic scorpion,
firing waves of energy randomly.
<P>
"Gun Wolf! Get down man!! You’re not going to help us much if you get
yourself fried!" Valentine screamed as he unjammed his M1989A1 assault rifle.
A bright green arc of plasma decimated the street in front of Gun Wolf,
blowing chunks of ancient pavement into the air as neon green smoke floated
upwards. Gun Wolf was thrown backwards, landing on his back in an alley.
The three-eyed guy ran into the alley, strafing the Scorpitron with his MAC-17.
<P>
"DAMN!... Hey, I’m Brother Creed, ex-Citadel monk. You must be the fresh-meat
Valentine recruited. Gun Wolf, was it?" the bald three-eyed guy gasped
between breaths as he hit the clip release on his submachine-gun.
He slid a fresh thirty-shot clip into his gun and pulled the switch back;
locked n’ loaded. 
<P>
"Yeah... I’m Gun Wolf. I think I’m a Private or something.
Any how... you guys need a hand?" Gun Wolf said as he clutched his Uzi
with both hands. He tried to sound brave, but inside he was scared shitless.
How could his dinky nine-millimeter Uzi do anything against a giant machine
like that if the assault rifle Valentine was carrying wasn’t even putting
pok-marks in it?
<P>
"Most pleasing. Now get in action, private... we got an android to
<!-- f**k --> frak up." Creed smirked as he ran out of the alley.
Gun Wolf could hear rapid fire shortly after that. He closed his eyes,
for deep down he had doubts about this Ranger squad’s survival.
Putting that beside him, he grasped his gun and ran out of the alley.
<P>
Taking aim for the Scorpitron’s face, he thought he might be able to destroy
the censors if they were located in the head. Depressing the trigger,
he let out a series of three-shot bursts. Bullets pinged off the dingy metal
face of the Scorpitron, barely leaving a scratch. Gun Wolf arrived on the
other side of the road. More green blasts of plasma ripped open the building
Gun Wolf was hiding behind. Terror shot through him as debris pelted him.
Scrambling out from the wreckage, Gun Wolf panicked and ran.
The Scorpitron sent several beams of energy at him, blowing through the road
at his heels. 
<P>
Like a knight striding through flames of hell to rescue a fallen comrade,
the green-haired Ranger dove, out of nowhere, past the green pillars of death
and knocked Gun Wolf out of the line of fire. 
<P>
"GAMMA!!!" all three of the original Rangers yelled as the blasts of
florescent-green radioactive plasma engulfed Gun Wolf’s savior. 
<P>
"AAAAAAUGHHH!!!" Gamma yelled, the immense pain forming all over his body.
The Scorpitron’s deadly tail had claimed another kill. All that was left
of the ex-mercenary Gamma was a charred corpse, its kevlar suit fused
to the bones. 
<P>
Gun Wolf, wide-eyed with terror, emptied the clip into the Scorpitron’s head.
Valentine was full of rage, and yanked the emergency LAW Rocket from his back,
pulling the slide off the red button that fired the missile. Brother Creed,
like the Indian that Gamma had given his life over for some mysterious reason,
began emptying the clip of .45 slugs into the Scorpitron.
Yukoza slid an RPG-7 from his pack and readied it.
<P>
The missile screamed towards the Scorpitron. With an agile twist to the left,
the robot avoided the rocket to the face and instead,
the LAW rocket slammed right into its tail. Sparks flew all over the place as
the tail was mangled into a mass of circuitry and twisted metal.
The android’s main plasma cannon was out of commission. 
<P>
The Scorpitron’s back-up systems kicked in, going into its secondary assault
programs. A pair of Vulcan 20mm mini-guns popped out of the side of its head,
blazing away. The muzzle flashes could be compared to a series of
rapidly-occuring small explosions. Yukoza pulled some acrobatics and did a
series of handsprings, somersaults, and jumps to get to cover as the hail of
high-velocity twenty-millimeter full-metal jacket tracers screamed past him.
Valentine cursed under his breath as he performed a running Drop-An’-Roll
manuever to get behind a building as the white tracer bullets ripped apart the
sidewalk he was once kneeling on. Gun Wolf was hit twice in the arm as he
tried to haul ass. The bullets were clean exits though, so only largish
bleeding holes were left in his bicep. Gasping in agony, Gun Wolf
staggered to safety behind an old BFI dumpster, leaving a trail of crimson
behind. Brother Creed grabbed the RPG-7 the late Gamma had dropped and dove
behind an old flipped-over car just as the tracers blew away everything
behind him.
<P>
"SHIT!! How the hell are we supposed to kill this thing?!" Gun Wolf screamed.
His voice could hardly be made out over the roar of the Scorpitron’s mini-guns.
"Oh yeah! I’ve been hit twice!" 
<P>
"Quit bawling! You should be happy you’re alive! A good Ranger killed himself
saving your ass, so be grateful!" Valentine yelled back. He hardly dare stick
his head out to snap off a few shots from his M1989A1.
"I’m out of anti-tank missiles! And bullets only make funny noises when they
bounce off the armored plating on this thing! Anyone got any ideas!!?"
<P>
"Ninja know no fear.... Leave it to me." Yukoza yelled out,
still clutching the RPG-7. "All I need is another rocket... and the knowledge
that that cursed machine doesn’t have any more weapons."
<P>
"I’ve got Gamma’s R-P-G! Here... lemme throw it to you!" Brother Creed
yelled above the ear-splitting rampage of the Scorpitron’s Vulcan assault-guns.
Did that thing ever run out of ammo? Brother Creed wound up,
gripped the rocket tube, and chunked it over to the collapsed building
Yukoza was leaning against. The ninja skillfully caught it with his other
hand and slung it over his shoulder, along with the one he was clutching.
He then whipped out his trusty XL-85 laser carbine and began scaling the
building, slowly making his way to the roof.
<P>
Gun Wolf was feeling faint, and was making a rather large puddle under him.
Fatigue was beginning to rear its ugly head, and the dumpster was beginning
to fragment, so he figured he’d act now. As he picked up his Uzi and clapped
a fresh clip in, his foot brushed something. What was this? A land-mine! 
<P>
An idea came over the Indian as he pulled his knife out. He began gouging the
dirt around the mine, very carefully so he wouldn’t blow himself up,
until he could pull it out of the ground. Like a bomb-squad operative with a
milk-jug of nitro glycerine, Gun Wolf stood up and held the landmine with his
good arm.
<P>
Gun Wolf clutched the land-mine like a frisbee (a lot heavier than a frisbee
though) and spun around like shotput thrower and let it go. The dark green
landmine soared through the air, right at the Scorpitron’s back, at its
armored thorax. It flopped down right on the pressure-plate of the mine on the
Scorpitron’s back and detonated. It weakened the heavy armor on the thorax,
where its legs join together.
<P>
Yukoza, now reaching the roof, peered over the side with his trusty laser
carbine. Clicking it to "full-auto", he pointed down to the cracked plate
on its thorax and peered through the scope. A series of florescent blue beams
rained down, splitting the crack into a tiny crevace, and a crevace into a
small trench. He set down the empty laser gun and pulled the two rockets off
his back. Setting one down next to the rifle carbine, he popped the scope up
and took aim with the other missile.
<p>
<B><FONT FACE="AdLib BT" SIZE=5>BOOM!!!</B></FONT>
<P>
One explosion later, the cracked plate split wide open, exposing the
ammunition-storage area. There were all sorts of rockets, fusion batteries,
and huge cylinders of twenty-millimeter slugs. Yukoza dropped the empty
rocket tube and picked up the other one, with his carbine.
<P>
The Scorpitron, not taking a liking to death-from-above tactics,
pointed the Vulcans skyward and opened fire at Yukoza’s position.
The white-hot bullets tore open the building and turned it into rubble.
The rest of the Rangers watched in wide-eyed astonishment as the building
was blown to bits. No sign of the ninja.
<P>
Valentine plucked a grenade from his pack and popped the pin out.
With a pitcher’s accuracy, he landed the grenade into the exposed ammunition
compartment. 
<P>      
<B><FONT FACE="AdLib BT" SIZE=5>FRAG-A-BOOM!!!</B></FONT>
<P>
The explosion ignited the ammo-storage, and sent the Scorpitron into huge
chunks of scrapnel and flaming cinders. Metal rained down by the rejoicing
Rangers, but the merriment was soon forgotten as they ran towards the rubble
of the building to look for Yukoza.
<P>
Brother Creed was the one that found Yukoza, buried under a bunch of tile.
He was out cold, but still alive. Brother Creed pulled out his Medic-Kit
and began bandaging up the holes in Gun Wolf’s arm.
<P>
<P align="center">* * * *</p>
<P>
"Well, Senior Specialist, we regret the loss of the brave Desert Ranger,
Gamma Ivory’s, sacrifice, but also, we are happy to have you aboard on the
squad." Valentine said, standing there by Gamma’s shallow grave.
What had happened to his former friend that made him sacrifice himself
for some guy he hardly knew? They had buried Gamma with his armor on,
since it was now part of his genetic code, and left the sleek black &amp;
oak AK-97 assault rifle, fully loaded, by the twelve-inch combat knife
with Gamma’s dog-tags wrapped around the blade when it was sunk into the
ground.
<P>
"Well, I’m glad to have been recruited... and I’m sorry about Gamma,
but I have a big problem. I need a fusion cell, or my tribe’s screwed."
Gun Wolf replied solemnly. There was a long bandage wrapped around his arm,
and the wounds underneath were healing nicely since Brother Creed’s high
doctor skills.
<P>
"Fusion cell, eh? You might be able to find some from where I come from.
Y’know, the Gaurdians of The Old Order, in that big citadel. They use’em
to power their brain-wash machines. Only problem is that they’d kill
me on sight since I betrayed them, and they really hate Desert Rangers."
Brother Creed spoke up, blinking all three of his eyes as he cleaned his
field-stripped MAC-17. "Only person who could get into that place would be
Yukoza, and I don’t even think he’d walk out of there on two legs.
Only way we can get into that place is with a Meson Cannon!"
<P>
"What’s a Meson Cannon?" Gun Wolf quiered, watching the ex-monk casually
blink that weird-looking third eye in the middle of his forehead.
<P>
"Its kinda like the energy gun that wasted poor Gamma, but its hand-held
and much more powerful. If you ever see someone with a Meson Cannon,
just hide and pray to God that he or she’s not looking for you."
Creed responded, finishing up the cleaning process for his submachine-gun
and quickly re-assembling it. He had just got done putting the firing
mechanism back in, by the recoil-reducer.
<P>
"Youch. Anywhere else I might find a fusion cell?" 
<P>
"Sewers!" Yukoza spoke up suddenly, with this heavy asian accent.
His masked head popped up from meditation and was staring at Gun Wolf with
his cold, dead, pupil-less eyes that had a way of burning into your soul.
"When we put that robotic, Max, back together. We had a ROM board,
a fusion cell, and a servo motor left over. Maybe you could run back
and get them."
<P>
"Great! Where’d you leave’em?"
<P>
"I think we put them in the laboratory, on that counter." Valentine piped up,
still staring down at Gamma’s grave.
<P>
"Alright. I’ll go get ’em." 
<P>
"Wait." Valentine said as he picked up Gamma’s AK-97. He slid an
ammunition-box from his pack and threw them both to Gun Wolf. Gun Wolf caught
them awkwardly. "Gamma’s dead. I figure if you’ll be in his spot, at least
take his piece and honor his memory, since he did save your arse and got his
turned into stray carbon atoms in the process. There’s sixty
seven-point-sixty-two-millimeter eff em’ jays in that box... enough to refill
that clip twice."
<P>
"Now c’mon... I can’t take his gun... it’d be disrespectful."
<P>
"You ever try to waste a hexborg with an Uzi? It's about as easy as playing
pool with a piece of rope. Take Gamma’s rifle, or die in those sewers."
Valentine ordered sternly. 
<P>
"He’s right, Gun Wolf. My mac-seventeen is about as effective on those
cyborgs as harsh language. You’re better off with the assault rifle."
Brother Creed said solemnly, seeing the 7.62mm "Mutie-Killer",
as Gamma called it, being passed down.
<P>
"Fine." Gun Wolf reluctantly agreed. He holstered his Uzi and grabbed the
AK-97. The old Soviet piece of artillery was still in excellent shape,
and the words "MUTIE-KILLER" were skillfully engraved on the side of the
shiny black barrel. A blood-red rabbit’s foot was dangling from the handle.
"Where are you guys headed next?"
<P>
"Problably to look for Covenant. He’s problably in this city.
We’ll meet with you in Quartz, in the Stage Coach Inn."
Yukoza murmured from his meditation. "Give us time to rest.
Here’s a map <!-- to --> that I made of the sewers." Yukoza nodded as he
flung a folded parchment at Gun Wolf.
<P>
"Oh yeah... Gun Wolf, in case you encounter any bonified CYBORGS, use this."
Creed said as he pulled a gray object from under his kevlar suit.
He clapped it into Gun Wolf’s hand and forced his fingers over it.
<P>
"Laser pistol. Fully charged, gots fourty shots in it. Use it only
in emergencies. And I expect that back when you get to Quartz." 
<P>
<P align="center">* * * *</p>
<P>
Gun Wolf, knee-deep in the sewer muck, clutched the Mutie-Killer(TM)
AK-97 tightly as he searched around the sewers. By the looks of the map,
he could tell he was almost in the laboratory. Only the dripping of water,
the sloshing of his own footsteps, and the occassional lupine howl were
heard as he trudged through the tunnels. 
<P>
A Centurion Delux popped up, whirring with a mechanicle scream as it kicked
up sludge-water everwhere when it shot up in front of the solitary Ranger.
Gun Wolf’s eyes narrowed as a mixture of fear and rage shot through his veins,
and he busted open the Centurion’s metal/flesh patchwork skull with
a well-placed burst to the face. Sparks kicked up and Gun Wolf sent a
snap-kick into its stomach to topple it over.
<P>
<I>Right around this corner...</I>
<P>
Gun Wolf entered the laboratory to find shell-casings, bullet-holes,
an empty table used to assemble robots, and pieces of machinery all over the
place. A small bag was on a counter,
next to a forgotten VP91Z nine-millimeter. Grabbing the automatic,
he tucked it into his vest and picked up the bag.
He hurriedly plucked the bag open and looked inside: servo motor,
battery with glowing green gel on side, weird computer chip thing.
<P>
Gun Wolf grabbed the battery and examined it quickly. He could make out the
faded words "XVK-80 Fusion Cell" on the side. A smile stretched across his
tan face as he tucked the fusion cell into his vest and retraced his steps
out of the sewers....
<P>
<P align="center">* * * *</p>
<P>
After killing three cyborgs on his way back, he arrived back in Vegas.
Gun Wolf’s brain was racked over whether or not he should go to Quartz,
or to haul it over to the village. As a Warroid Mark 2 was blown to bits
by a landmine, Gun Wolf heard the familiar sound of a motor.
Turning his head, he caught a glimpse of a group of punks in a jeep,
shooting up things with their rifles. If he could get that jeep....
<P>
Gun Wolf whipped out the laser-sighted Uzi and took careful aim as the punks
turned around for another run. Ever since Valentine, Yukoza, Creed, and
himself took out the Scorpitron, the locales began running around more on
killing sprees. Most of them were just thugs, but occassionally some would
be mopping up the Warroids and Cyborg Commando squads.
<P>
"HA HAA HA! Lookit that Ind’an! Take’em out Joe!!" one of the punks yelled,
firing his carbine in Gun Wolf’s direction. A shot pinged off an ancient
STOP-sign next to Gun Wolf’s head. The Indian, however, was in a cunning mood.
<p>
The red dot appeared on the driver’s neck as he sped by. 
<P>
<B><FONT FACE="AdLib BT">B</B>RRRRRP! <B>B</B>RRRP!</FONT>
<p>
The bullets maimed the hell out of the jeep’s occupants.
Blood shot up all over the place as the mild rain of nine-millimeters tore
them open. The jeep spun around and screeched to a halt, the corpses looking
like a 200-piece puzzle made specifically for undertakers.
<P>
"Heh.... I’m too smooth." Gun Wolf chuckled as he strode over to the jeep.
He grabbed the dead driver and opened the door, throwing him out.
He then grabbed the bloody corpses in the back seat and dropped them onto the
pavement as well. Climbing in, he looked around in the jeep.
A few blood-stains, nice leather interior, two M1989A1 NATO 7.62mm assault
rifles, a few 7.62mm clips he could use for Gamma’s AK-97 or the M1989A1,
a box of six grenades, two Sabot rockets, an armored Rad-Suit someone
should’ve been wearing, a weird-looking sword that was obviously made out of a
chainsaw, a belt full of throwing knives, five clips of .45-caliber ammo,
and a few bundles of TNT.
<I>Someone must’ve been out to kill alot of people...</I> Gun Wolf thought
as he changed his equipment. He noticed a small red switch next to the
steering wheel. The words: "<FONT FACE="Xerox Serif Wide" SIZE=2>100,000 Volt
Secure-All(TM) System</FONT>"
<P>
He was now wearing the yellow radiation-suit, without the hood,
a small ALICE pack with six grenades going down one of the straps,
Gamma’s AK-97 on his back, and an M1989A1 NATO assault rifle in his hands.
He looked kind of like a heavilly-armed astronaut without the big helmet.
The jeep’s gas tank was two-thirds full, and there were two five-gallon cans
of gas in the back seat, next to the small arsenal. He began driving
down the street, when a pair of Warroids began driving after him.
<P>
<B><FONT FACE="AdLib BT" SIZE=4>BOOM!!!</FONT></b>
<P>
An artillery shell exploded next to the jeep. Gun Wolf swerved as high-speed
Warroids continued tailing him. Gun Wolf switched gears and sped up a few
meters ahead of the malicious tanks.
<P>
<B><FONT FACE="AdLib BT" SIZE=4><P>BOOM!!!</B></FONT>
<P>
Another explosion came, blowing a small building away as the Warroids with
flawed aiming-circuitry continued missing. Gun Wolf grabbed one of the bundles
of TNT from the back seat and tried something ballsy.
Swerving towards the flaming rubble that used to be some bum’s house,
he put his arm out held the dynamite in the flames as he sped by.
The Warroid tanks weren’t far behind, and continued firing off artillery
shells.
<P>
It worked! He had lit the fuse without blowing off his arm, and watched
as the string burned down to a reasonable ammount. Lobbing the dynamite
backwards, he hoped for the best.
<P>
<B><FONT FACE="AdLib BT" SIZE=4><P>BOOM!!!</B></FONT>
<P>
One of the tanks exploded in a giant ball of fire as the TNT reduced it to
flaming cinders. The other tank crashed into its former comrade-in-arms,
flipping it over. Gun Wolf was home free, for now. He then sped out of
Las Vegas, towards his small village....
<P>
<P align="center">* * * *</p>
<P>
Gun Wolf ran into some difficulties on his way back to the village.
A small band of cyborg commandoes wanted a piece of him.
<P>
"Get the human!" cried a mechanical voice as a hail of assault-rifle fire
rained past him. Gun Wolf swerved and plowed into one of the four gunmen,
tearing him in two with the radial tires on the jeep. He rested the barrel
of his M1989A1 NATO on the side of the door as he drove by, popping off a
series of bursts and cutting down two of the commandoes. That left one.
Gun Wolf took careful aim and blew out the semi-human’s legs as he hit the
brakes, the jeep skidding to a halt.
<P>
"GAHH! STUPI-*CRACKLE!* HUMAN! **FizzZLe!* GAARGHHK! &lt;&lt;PROGRAM FAILED!
Re-Route Objectives; New Objective: Self Destruct&gt;&gt;" cried the cyborg
commando, writhing on the ground in pain as motor oil flowed down its legs.
Its assault rifle was in the dirt, about a meter away from its titanium-alloy
hand. A small explosion occured inside of the cyborg’s torso, sending its
robotic limbs all over the place. Gun Wolf and the jeep were unharmed by the
last attempt to kill him, thanks to the jeep’s tough exterior.
<P>
<I>Damn. The robots have already begun swarming this area! I hope I’m not too
late.</I>
<P>
<P align="center">* * * *</p>
<P>
Gun Wolf arrived in the Black Ravens’ village. There was some fighting going
on, mainly by the warriors holding back the occassional squad of android foes.
The village seemed smaller than it had before. 
<P>
As he stepped out of the jeep, he was gathered around by people,
all silent and awe-struck by the outcast’s jeep, his hi-tech "armor" and guns,
and the cyborg upper-torso that was stuck on the grill of the automobile.
<P>
"Wow! You look great!"
<P>
"Meet any women?"
<P>
"You don’t look like you got radioactive mutation..." 
<P>
"Have you found the fusion cell?" 
<P>
"Did you actually use that gun on somebody?" 
<P>
"How’d you survive?" 
<P>
The questions came like bullets do when Valentine goes into a berzerker-kill
mode with that damn M1989A1 he’s always carrying. Finally Koh ran out of the
crowd, smiling brightly as she saw Gun Wolf. She was a little surprised at
his sudden transfer from outcast guy to absolute bad-ass. She jumped up and
hugged him. Gun Wolf, blushing as he wrapped his muscled arms around Koh,
spun her around as if they were in one of those old movies.
Koh seemed a tad tougher than she was when he first left.
<P>
"I’VE GOT THE FUSION CELL!!!" he yelled above everyone’s bombardment of
quieries. His statement silenced the crowd for a brief moment.
Their silenced was shattered into oblivion as they let off a roar of cheering.
<P>
<P align="center">* * * *</p>
<P>
After staying the night [in Koh’s tent, but lets not get into that.
This isn’t one of those novels with Fabio on the cover -- V],
he awoke to the sound of music. Clambering out of bed and putting his pants
on, he walked out of the tent to see people dancing around fires and food
being served en masse. Obviously they were celebrating their "Victory"
over the invasion. Some how Gun Wolf felt annoyed, knowing they were problably
celebrating for their own victories and not the fact it was all his hard work
and suffering that brought them the fusion cell. Then he remembered the Desert
Rangers, problably on their way back to Quartz if not already there.
The Rangers, Yukoza, Brother Creed, Valentine, the ex-Gamma, were the ones
that helped him on finding the fusion cell. Koh sat up, taking one of the
covers to hide her naked upper body, and rubbed her eyes.
<P>
"What’s going on?" Gun Wolf asked as he glanced over to the Rad Suit,
ALICE-Pack, and M1989A1 sitting in the corner.
<P>
"Ohh... the village planned a celebration for you if you returned.
We were going to cancel it, because you’ve been gone almost a month.
We thought you were dead." Koh responded, brushing her hair back from her
face.
<P>
"Oh. Want to go take part in the festivities?" Gun Wolf smirked.
<P>
"Sure.... Where’d you learn such big words?" 
<P>
"Desert Rangers. I swear Creed and Valentine must have I.Q.s of 46."
<P>
They left the tent, while people sang and danced, and made utter fools of
themselves. Everyone was happy as they sat Gun Wolf down at a huge table
full of food. Women tried to hug and kiss Gun Wolf, but he gently pushed
them away. The town gathered around the large table and they feasted on
grilled Gilla Monitors, deep-fried Nuke Pooch, lots of alcohol, and other
delicacies. Gun Wolf passed out in Koh’s tent some time around midnight,
from all the booze.
<P>
After waking up again, fully clothed and an empty flask of tequila in his
hand, he got up with one of the worst hang-overs in Black Raven history.
He clutched his aching head and sat down outside of the tent.
Then he threw up.
<P>
About three hours later, he woke up again feeling better.
The Chief was standing over him, flanked by two of his most trusted gaurds.
Gun Wolf stood up, ignoring the ol’ "Bow down to your master" traditions.
He brushed himself off and rubbed his eyes.
<P>
"You are hero, Gun Wolf. The village loves you.... All the children want to be
like you, and the men and women admire you. I’d like you to stay in village.
No more quests... village safe now." The Chief said hoarsely,
with his gravel-in-my-throat voice. 
<P>
Gun Wolf thought for a moment. He knew the village wasn’t going to be safe
until someone put an end to the robotic threat. Besides... he didn’t even like
this village that much. Only person he cared about was Koh, or that weird
creature in the store, Killja. Everyone else had treated him like crap
from the get-go. Then he brings back a little piece of machinery that the
Desert Rangers actually had a surplus of so they left some in the sewers and
BAM... everyone loves him. He knew he should’ve been proud of what he had done,
but he didn’t even want to go on the quest to begin with.
The only way he could keep Killja and Koh safe is if he joined back with the
Desert Rangers. They actually gave a damn about him, for some reason.
They were more like friends than just guys with guns he met up with in a bar.
Besides, didn’t they say they were going after the source of the robots?
The Desert Rangers were the key to solving it all. After he’d help them
destroy whatever it was making all those robots, he’d settle down and come
back here because everything would be safe again. Those thoughts raced
through his head. 
<P>
"I can’t stay. Ko--err, the village isn’t going to be safe until all
of those robots are wiped out. There’s only one way to do that."
<P>
"How?" The Chief had a expression of surprise on his withered face.
<P>
"There’s a group of vigilantes called the Desert Rangers. I met up with
some of them on my travels, and they’re going after the source of the robots.
They want me to help them."
<P>
"Well..." the Chief was trying to put his feelings into words.
"I understand.... But I regret you having to leave so soon after you get back." 
<P>
"Don’t be. This town doesn’t seem like they’d miss me much." 
<P>
"Well... as a parting gift, go down to Killja’s armory. When he killed a
group of devils, one of them had a strange weapon that shot deadly rays of
light. Killja has it in his shop, doing some work on it.
Also, take this." The Chief handed Gun Wolf a small box. 
<P>
"Thank you...what is this?" Gun Wolf inquired as he stared down at the old box.
It had the faded words "Adidas" on it. 
<P>
"Strange shoes... very comfortable, and well suited for running.
They don’t fit me... my feet too big."
<P>
Gun Wolf opened the box to reveal some jet-black shoes with three white
stripes going down the sides. He pulled off his moccasins and put on the shoes.
They were a nice fit... and the shoes were very comfortable. 
<P>
"Well... go to Killjas... take the weapon of light."
<P>
<P align="center">* * * *</p>
<P>
Gun Wolf entered the shop, after changing into his Rad-Suit and ALICE-Pack.
He did so with the utmost stealth so he wouldn’t wake Koh.
<P>
Killja’s shop hadn’t changed much. There still some interesting guns
and on the counter, next to the large Browning .30-caliber "Potato-Digger"
machine gun, was the weapon the Chief had described. 
<P>
"Whoa... hey, Gun Wolf. The Chief told me to get this gun ready for you.
I made some adjustments, so its a pretty sweet piece of hardware.
Old H&amp;K M-99 Laser Rifle, anti-personnel model. I’ve added a night-scope,
a laser-sight, and adjusted the trigger for a smoother pull. Found some big
battery-lookin’ things on the corpse as well... might be what the gun runs on."
Killja squeaked as he threw the laser rifle to Gun Wolf, who caught it with
ease. He slid the gun onto his back, on the spare rifle-strap on the side of
his ALICE-pack, right next to the AK-97. He picked up the strange power packs
and tucked them into his ALICE-pack as well. 
<P>
"Thanks, Killja. Hope I see you again." Gun Wolf said as he walked
out of the store.
<P>
<P align="center">* * * *</p>
<P>
Gun Wolf arrived in Quartz, pulling up in the jeep outside of the Stagecoach
Inn. He hopped out of the automobile and and activated the security system.
If anyone were to try to steal his jeep, there was going to be some crispy
critters nearby. He approached the building and swung open the door.
<P>
The Inn was pretty roomy. There was a lobby with a dead body slumped over the
counter, several bullet-holes as well as blood-stains on the wall behind the
carcass. An open safe, empty, was on the wall by counter. There was another
dead body by a doorway leading into a diner. It was unrecognizable,
because his face had been blown off. Gun Wolf scratched his stubbled chin,
wondering who the unlucky bastard was. He could hear people laughing
somewhere north of where he was standing. Walking through a doorway,
he could see several doors with numbers on them and a large pool,
where Valentine, Yukoza, and the three-eyed Brother Creed were sitting,
knocking back beers.
<P>
"Heheh... hey, Gun Wolf. How’d you get here so fast?" Valentine smirked,
setting his beer down next to his all-too-familiar M1989A1. 
<P>
"Found some jeep full of gear... pretty quick transportation."
Gun Wolf replied, looking around. 
<P>
"Waitasec...was there a large chainsaw sword in the jeep?!" Yukoza perked up.
This was probably one of the only times Gun Wolf’s ever seen Yukoza show
excitement.
<P>
"Yeah. Its still in the back of the jeep." 
<P>
"YES! That was our jeep!" Creed blinked with the trio of eyes.
"We were in Las Vegas and some assholes stole it when we forgot to turn on the
security system! Pissed us off, since a lot of our ammunition and stuff
was on it... including Yukoza’s beloved Kamikaze Edge." 
<P>
"Well, its out front. Hit the red switch within five seconds after you sit
in the driver’s seat or else you’ll get fried." 
<P>
"Hmm...I think my old NATO was in that jeep." Valentine yawned as he
stretched his thin, lightly-muscled arms out and arched his back.
<P>
"This it?" Gun Wolf asked as he yanked his recently-acquired assault rifle
from his back. 
<P>
"I think so. No matter... you hold on to it. I’ve got a better one now.
Hey Yukoza---eh?" 
<P>
Yukoza was gone. Gun Wolf figured he’d probably went to get that big-ass
chainsaw katana of death laying in the jeep.  
<P>
<P align="center">* * * *</p>
<P>
Gun Wolf woke up the next morning, and clambered out of bed.
The others were sitting around a table, eating. They had no plates,
but were chowing down on some weird rations. Yukoza was oiling this
big-ass chainsaw sword while Valentine and Creed ate Emergency MRE
rations from the foil packaging. 
<P>
"Damn... hard to find good things to eat around here. Especially since
Valentine’s dumb-ass blew up Hobo Dogs with that freakin’ howitzer shell."
Brother Creed chuckled, his mouth half-full of Emergency MRE.
Creed was wearing a white t-shirt with the words "NOFX: Punk In Drublic"
on the front of it, his pair of BDU pants, and some old Wolverine boots.
<P>
"There was hair in my food, and they wouldn’t gimme a refund.
They had to pay!" Valentine laughed. The spikey-headed survivalist was wearing
his ballistics goggles (he probably never takes them off), a wife-beater,
a pair of black leather pants, a shoulder-holster containing his Uzi Mark 27
SMG, and his biker boots sported a set of blood-stained spurs. 
<P>
"Didn’t mean you had to kill three people and level a building.
You could’ve just robbed the place. Besides, you ordered deep-fried scalps...
of course there was going to be hair in your food." Creed laughed and stood up.
He adjusted his shirt and looked around. 
<P>
"Hey...." Gun Wolf groaned as he stretched.
"What’s with those dead bodies out in the lobby?"
Gun Wolf picked up his Rad-Suit and climbed into it.
He zipped up the suit and slid the armored boots over his Adidas and sat
down on the bed.
<P>
"The one by the diner was Mulefoot... some <!-- dickhead --> butthead that
wanted some of us.  Yukoza took off his face with a burst to the head.
The clerk was talkin’ crap to Creed because of his third eye so we robbed him.
Creed hopped the counter and ventilated his ass, and we raided the safe."
Valentine explained, field-stripping his M1989A1 NATO as he was speaking.
<P>
"How did you get that third eye, Creed" Gun Wolf asked. 
<P>
"Well, back when I was a brainwashed zombie for the Gaurdians Of the Old Order,
something happened to me and I began to regain my free will somehow.
When I refused to kill something, the other combat monks turned on me and tried
to kill me. So I fled into the wastes and passed out.
I woke up with all of my hair missing, a sixth toe on my left foot,
and this damn eye in the middle of my forehead.
Lucky for me, I can see better and shoot three-times as good as the average
ex-Old Order bastich." Creed enlightened his inquisitive Indian friend.
<P>
"How did you survive? Usually when you reach that bad of a radiation
zone people die." 
<P>
"Our late friend Gamma and his squad found me. I woke up in a hospital
being pumped full of anti-rad and getting some of those plastic organs
they used to use in partial-cyborgs, since a few of mine had turned into jelly
and I’d puked them up earlier. I ran with Gamma’s crew for a while...."
<P>
"Then what happened?" 
<P>
"We hung around Highpool for a while, helping them out. Then we went to
Needles, hearing stories about robot activity in this weird cultist temple.
Gamma’s prime directives were to seek out the source of the robot threat.
We got caught up in this big scandal over this stolen magic artifact, the
Bloodstaff, so we decided we’d help. Well, we were going to get the
Bloodstaff back from the Temple Of Blood...." 
<P>
"Then what happened?"
<P>
Creed sighed. "Things got screwed up... we got the Bloodstaff,
but Paso and Sasha were killed." 
<P>
"I’m sorry...how’d they die?"
<P>
"We should’ve done reconassainse first.... I knew we should’ve... we had no
problem with the gaurds. Gamma’s AK-97 tore them apart with those
three-o’-eight-caliber rounds, and my MAC-17 ripped many of the gaurds new
assholes. But the crap hit the AC unit when Paso’s M-19 jammed up while
Sasha was laying down cover-fire with her UZI..."
<P>
<P>"Then what?"
"These.... these robots popped up, just like Gamma said were around.
They blew Sasha away faster than I could turn around to squeeze off a burst.
Paso tried to save her, and those Killers shot him a few times.
I got shot up pretty bad, but Gamma let loose with the assault-rifle
and saved my ass. Paso’s still barely alive, but he insists on fighting.
I blacked out after a few minutes of seeing Paso and Gamma firing
at these robots. Next thing I know I woke up being carried on Gamma’s back
while he was running like hell to the local hospital. Gamma told me he
jumped around on this chessboard and killed about thirty people trying
to get the Bloodstaff. Paso was killed during the fire-fight.
Said it was skill why he survived, but I think it was the fact he was the
only man in Needles that packed an AK-97." Creed finished, looking
remorseful as he stared at his MRE scraps. Valentine said nothing,
resting solemnly in his seat, putting his weapon back together.
"But Gamma’s dead.... He gave me these though. Said something about cloning,
but I can’t remember. It was before I was shot to hell, so I can’t recall
much...." Creed held up a tiny jug. The jug, an old fuel container used
before the Big Blast, made the <I>"I’ve got liquid in me!"</I> noise
you get when a container’s half empty. 
<P>
"I wonder what this is, any way." 
<P>
"Don’t know... hold onto it, though. Well, how’d you wind up with
Valentine and Yukoza?" Gun Wolf dug in. If he was going to run around
and risk his life with these psuedo-militia types,
he needed to know their history. 
<P>
"Well, the Ranger Center decided to send in some replacements... some
higher-ranking people that they knew could do the job and not get blown
away half-way through doing it... that's when they sent in Senior Specialist
Valentine and Specialist Yukoza. Gamma was only a PFC, but he was a good
leader considering we were just a group of Privates." Creed replied,
finishing off the MRE and throwing the wrapper aside. 
<P>
"What’s your story, Valentine?" Gun Wolf asked. 
<P>
"Well... if you survive this
<I>‘Find The Cyborg Threat And Exterminate Them’</I> ordeal,
maybe I’ll tell you." Valentine smirked as he stood up.
The spikey-haired soldier-esque Ranger stood up and looked around.
He slid out of his clothes until he was only wearing his wife-beater and a
pair of boxers, and put on his
<B><FONT FACE="CAC Saxon Bold" SIZE=2>USMC SHOCK-TROOPER</B></FONT> kevlar
suit. The black kevlar-plated body-armor suit looked pretty cool on
Valentine in Gun Wolf’s opinion. "Gear up.... We’re headin’ out in an hour.
Where the hell’s Yukoza?"
<P>
"I dunno... might be swimming in that pool." Creed shrugged as he slid
into his Rad-Suit and zipped up the armored apparel.
The ex-monk picked up his pack and slid it on. "Hey... Gun Wolf."
<P>
"Yeah?" Gun Wolf replied as he slid his pack on and took inventory.
He had an AK-97, a Laser Rifle, an M1989A1, a Laser Pistol, an Uzi, five
.308 (7.62mm) clips, six 9mm clips, a couple of bundles of TNT,
a few energy packs, a chainsaw, and a pack of cigarettes. 
<P>
"Can I have Gamma’s AK-97? I knew him a lot better than you did...
not to be rude or anything, but It’d make me feel better if I knew my friend’s
gun was with me." 
<P>
"Sure. The Mutie-Killer’s yours." Gun Wolf smiled with his tan,
war-painted face as he threw the sentimental Creed the deceased
Gamma’s assault rifle. Creed caught the weapon, and like a kid getting his new
Johnny Destructo(TM) toy for Christmas, lit up with a huge smile ear-to-ear.
<P>
"Thanks! You don’t know how much this gun means to me."
Creed smiled as he began checking the assault rifle over.
<P>
<P align="center">* * * *</p>
<P>
The four Rangers sat outside on the jeep, bristling with weaponry ranging from
chainsaw arnament to anti-tank missiles. Yukoza leaned casually on the side
of the armored vehicle, his large Kamikaze Edge on his back,
and his Laser Carbine in his hands. Brother Creed casually stood,
clad in his Rad-Suit with the Mutie-Killer AK-97 in his hands,
and his pack strapped on. Gun Wolf stood next to Creed, wearing his own
Rad-Suit, and held his Laser Rifle with one hand.
Valentine just rested casually, leaning against the fence of the StageCoach
Inn, clutching his ever-so-trusty M1989A1 NATO, his chainsaw on his back,
and three grenades on the strap of his pack. He was wearing the
SHOCK-TROOPER kevlar suit.
<P>
"Well... what do we do now?" Gun Wolf inquired, cleaning his laser rifle.
He kept that piece squeaky-clean, partially afraid that it might explode or
something if the fusion-chamber was obstructed. So the shiny jet-black finish
remained untarnished.
<P>
"Easy. We try to find the cyborg threat... and nail it.
Max told us to go to the Sleeper Base... but we’re going to hit the
Gaurdian Citadel first. Pay your old buds a visit, Desert Ranger-style,
eh Creed?" Valentine spoke, a sense of command in his words.
"We need to acquire the necessary <!-- [sic] --> tools of destruction
if we’re going to hit that old military base.
Last thing I want is to have to go against a horde of bloodthirsty
cyborgs with an assault-rifle or a small-caliber laser weapon."
<P>
"Well, we’ve got decent armor now... we could last for about an hour in there.
But we’ll need more ammo, since those weird robes they wear are capable of
turning laser blasts into cigarette burns." Creed remarked.
<P>
"Problem solved." Yukoza spoke. "Last night I paid the Emporium a visit..."
the Rangers might of actually saw a smile under the mask of the Kung-Fu
bad-arse as he produced a large duffle bag.
"It took a chunk of my money, but I bought enough three-o’-eight caliber clips
for all of us." He distributed the 7.62mm magazines by the handful to his
companions.
<P>
"Oooh... nice one, Yukoza. Well, we’re gonna hit Citadel.
But we’re walking." Valentine ordered. Various groans came from the squad.
"Quit being lazy-ass bastards. There’s no need to waste fuel on a trip
we can hike it. Now pack up, shut up, and let’s go!"
<P>
<P align="center">* * * *</p>
<P>
They arrived to the Gaurdian Citadel at about 0600 hours. Turns out the
goggles on Valentine’s head weren’t ballistics goggles... they were
IR-Smartgoggles... some of the best night-vision and tactical warfare
eyewear you could buy... before the bombs. Lord knows how a punk-esque
Desert Ranger got ahold of some. The safety was off on his assault-rifle
and he was lurking about, creeping up to the large Citadel in his dark-gray
kevlar-suit, which blended in nicely with the desert sands in the night... at
least the parts that didn’t glow bright green. Gun Wolf watched as Valentine
motioned for the others to follow. There were no land-mines,
or those pesky SmartFire laser-turrets
(like the one that was gaurding the Bloodstaff). Everything in the op was
going smoothly, until the biggest monk the Rangers had ever seen planted a
field-goal kick into Valentine out of nowhere, sending the Desert Ranger
flying backwards. 
<P>
"Gah! Open fire! And somebody find my Wisdom teeth!" Valentine joked,
even under heavy combat. Gun Wolf recalled the book he read in the library...
<I><U>How to use Anti-Tank Weaponry (spears, rockets, manglers), by
Demolition Willy</u></I> and slid a LAW-Rocket from his pack. His eyes narrowed
as he got a bead on Brother David, who was laying down some heavy fire,
and clicked the trigger. 
<P>
<B><FONT FACE="Courier New" SIZE=4>BLAMMO!!</B></FONT>
<P>
Brother David’s upper torso exploded in a burst of intestines, gore,
bone fragments, and showered blood in everywhich direction.
Gun Wolf threw the smoking LAW tube at Brother Goliath, which bounced off
his head with no prevail of damage. Yanking his laser rifle from his back,
he looked around for more enemies after seeing Yukoza, Valentine,
and Brother Creed empty their assault-rifles in unison, ripping Goliath
apart and leaving only a bloody heap of torn-open flesh at the gate.
<P>
"Hey! The hell’s this?" Brother Creed chimed over the heavy gunfire as he
picked up a dirt-covered jug with unreadable words stenciled on the side.
"Looks like one of those jugs... y’know, the kind Gamma gave me before he was
vaporized! OW OW OW!" Creed was hit by a trio of tracer-slugs and rolled
onto his back, three smoking holes in his chest. "GAAGH! I’M HIT! MEDIC!
Aww crap! I’m the medic!" 
<P>
Gun Wolf low-crawled over to his wounded three-eyed comrade. Tricklets of
blood slid off the Rad-Suit’s rubber-like exterior. Hopefully his Doctor
skills would help him out, since Valentine and Yukoza were busy laying
down heat. Gun Wolf could hear the chattering of weapons and screams of monks.
Without further ado, he grabbed the Medic-Kit from Brother Creed’s belt and
unzipped it.
<P>
"Wolf! The hell’s going on back there!?" Valentine yelled. Gun Wolf’s
attention diverted to Valentine. He could see that Valentine was bleeding
from a gun-shot wound, but couldn’t see exactly where he’d been hit.
Yukoza’s laser carbine gave off beam after beam of high-intensity energy
that always seemed to rush to the mark, even if some of them didn’t do that
much harm. "Gun Wolf! What’s wrong with Creed!?"
<P>
"He’s been hit! Lay down some fire until I’ve got’em patched up!"
Gun Wolf yelled in response. He had already gotten one of the bullets out.
After gouging open the areas of the anti-radiation "rubber" on the Rad-Suit,
he found out that the bullets had slowed down drastically after hitting the
kevlar-plating underneath the high-density "rubber", thus leaving them not
even an inch in Brother Creed. Whipping out some forceps, he was about to
inject a dose of morphine into the ex-monk until he realized he’d passed
out from the pain. 
<P>
&lt;Three removed 7.62mm bullets, and about 10,000 fired 7.62mm’s later...&gt;
<P>
"Whoa... seems like we’ve wasted all of the perimeter soldiers...."
Valentine panted, laying in a heap of dead bodies. He had been hit seven times,
but for some reason he was still ticking. Maybe it was the fact Valentine
had taken an ungodly ammount of morphine for the pain. The torso-piece to the
kevlar suit lay next to him, as Gun Wolf loomed over the wounded Valentine and
began removing the bullets. "AGH! What’s wrong with you!? That hurt!"
<P>
"Quit being a pansy. If I give you any more chems you’ll OD and die...so
bare with me here. Creed, howyadoin’?" Gun Wolf remarked.
<P>
"I’m doing alright. Once Valentine’s patched up, I could take part in the
attempt to crack open their armory. But that place is locked up tighter than
a New Reno virgin!"
<P>
"A what?"
<P>
"Nothing...nevermind."
<P>
"Hmm...why is it that Yukoza’s always the one that never gets hit? I heard
about another guy like that... except he was American, and got his brains
blown out in some casino back in Vegas. Ace something...."
<P>
"Oh yeah.... I heard of him. OW! GET THOSE FORCEPS OUT OF MY SPINE!
He used to run with that old squad of Rangers led by the Dego brothers.
Those guys were hardcore... too bad they never came back from their mission.
That’s why Gamma was sent out... and after he got skragged, that’s why HQ
sent me and Yukoza out for replacement soldiers." Valentine remarked,
gritting his teeth as Gun Wolf plucked yet another bullet out of his back.
<P>
"Actually... we weren’t ‘sent out’..." Yukoza spoke up, straightening his
bandoliers. Valentine looked at Yukoza with one of those <I>Keep your
Japanese-anime mouth shut!</I> looks. Yukoza, however, didn’t heed the
glare... prolly because he and Valentine both knew Yukoza could probably
drop Valentine even if he was wearing Power Armor and wielding a
Meson-Cannon with a RPG-7 duct-taped to the side of it.
"Valentine and I were hired by the Desert Rangers to take part in the mission."
<P>
"Hired?" Brother Creed and Gun Wolf said in unison.
<P>
"Grrr...damn it, Yukoza. You weren’t supposed to tell them that!"
Valentine growled. "But since you’ve brought it up, I’ll just finish the story.
I’ve been a professional gunfighter for quite some time now. Yukoza here’s
one of the best assassins ever to step out of the background radiation.
So, the Desert Rangers gave us a contract and free training in return for an
all-expenses paid trip into the wastes to try to find the source of the robot
army. That’s why we were given the ranks of Specialists. Of course, we didn’t
plan on telling you guys we were mercenary Desert Rangers until AFTER
we’ve wasted whoever the hell keeps pumping out the droids."
<P>
"Yeesh... this <I>Exterminate The Robot Threat</I> mission’s taken the lives
of one and a half squads... and I’ve been working with mercenaries the
whole time." Brother Creed chuckled "I don’t care if you guys are hired
guns.... You’ve kept me alive this long, so I can’t really complain."
<P>
Gun Wolf just sat there. He didn’t mind the fact they were hired soldiers,
but he did wonder if they would turn on the rest of the squad if they were
offered more money. He casually bandaged the last of Valentine’s multiple
injuries and packed up the Medic-Kit.
<P>
<P align="center">* * * *</p>
<P>
"Whoa... something happened here, I can tell." Brother Creed whispered
to the squad as he looked around at all the blood-stains and bullet pock-marks
on the walls. Brother Creed himself had taken part in defending the Old
Order Citadel from the Anti-Mutie squad some time back, but due to
extensive brainwashing, the memories had been removed from his mind.
"Hey... the Armory’s this way."
<P>
The squad followed Brother Creed to a large door. Everybody looked at
Valentine (whose Lockpick skills were level 6). Immediately, he went to work.
About the same time, three Old Order monks ran into view, clutching AK-97s
and looking around. Valentine handed Gun Wolf a frag grenade and nodded his
head at the monks. Taking the cue, Gun Wolf popped the pin from the grenade
and rolled it between the monks.
<P>
<B><FONT FACE="Courier New" SIZE=5>BAM!</B></FONT>
<p>
With a loud pop, scrapnel flew in everywhich direction and tore open the monks.
Blood sprinkled on the ceiling as one of the monk’s jugular was sliced open.
Brother Creed followed up with a three-shot burst from the Mutie-Killer
into the bleeding monk’s forehead, which sent his brains on the wall behind
him. Yukoza sniped out the remaining monk with his laser carbine. 
<P>
*Kla-Chink!*
<P>
The armory door swung open and Valentine stepped in. The other Rangers
followed him. 
<P>
"Hmm... jack-pot. Check it out.... Creed, you’ve got the highest skill in
energy weapons... you take the Meson Cannon." Valentine whispered as he
distributed the laser arsenal. He took a laser rifle, and gave Yukoza the
other, since Gun Wolf already owned one. Brother Creed however,
was gawking at the large weapon in his hands.
<P> 
"Sweet!"
<P>
"Fill up on AK-97s and ammo... we can sell off the rifles when he get back
to town." Just as they got done filling up on energy packs, a click was heard.
Valentine’s eyes widened as he slowly brought his tool kit out and looked
under his hand, where the empty bag lay. A chunk of plastique was rigged
to go off any second. Scrambling with the tool-kit, Valentine used his
superb Bomb Disarm skills to stop the wad of explosives from going off.
"Okay... thank me later for saving everyone’s ass from a low-yield explosion."
<P>
"Quit over-doing yourself. We’d probably survive the blast anyway,
considering these cushy kevlar suits have taken crap from harsh language
from mutie brats in Highpool to AK-wielding Cyborg Commandos in Vegas."
Creed jested.
<P>
"Still... you’d make me feel better if JUST ONCE, you’d say ‘Wow Valentine,
you really saved our arses!’ when I actually DO." 
<P>
"Nah... we’re ingrates."
<P>
"I noticed."
<P>
Yukoza got an AK-97 locked-and-loaded while Creed and Valentine joked around.
He slapped the clip in, pulled the bolt back, checked the chamber,
loaded a round, then lowered the assault rifle to his side. 
<P>
"Take a look at this... this box looks brand new." Gun Wolf said as he pointed
out a rather large crate. Picking up a stray crowbar, he pried it open to
reveal just a bunch of styrofoam packing material. Still determined, he
continued digging around until he felt something solid. Groping around the firm
metal frame, he yanked the object out of the box.
<P>
"MESON CANNON! GET DOWN!" Creed spazzed and hit the deck. After realizing
the rest of the squad was staring at him like he was on more morphine than
Valentine was a few hours ago, he slowly regained his composure. "Errm...
sorry. They used to program us to immediately panic if anyone not wearing a
Citadel robe or Power Armor suit was wielding a Meson Cannon.
Just one of those things..."
<P>
"Whatever man... get off the floor, Creed. Gun Wolf... that is a very large
gun. I guess we go by the Scav’s Rules when it comes to weaponry... you loot
it, you shoot it." Valentine smirked. 
<P>
The squad left the Armory and went... or tried to go, down a hallway.
An insane woman wielding a pair of spikes and clad in a leather thong speedo
jumped out from behind a wall and nearly stabbed Gun Wolf in the face.
Dodging back a few feet, Gun Wolf levelled the Meson Cannon at the
Sister and squeezed the trigger. Not much of the squad remembered what
happened after that, but the smell of burnt flesh lingered in the air and
ashes were hard to trace, since the walls of the hallway were also in cinders.
Gun Wolf smiled until he tasted blood on his lips.
<P>
"Hmm... she sliced you." Yukoza smirked under his mask.
<P>
Just then, another monk wielding a strange-looking gun came out from
behind a corner. Yukoza swiftly levelled his laser carbine up with one hand
and fired a three-shot burst of energy beams into his skull, removing his
entire cranium from his body. Blood fountained into the air as the corpse
fell backwards. 
<P>
"That gun is mine!" Valentine declared as he ran up and grabbed it from the
corpse. He read the side of it. "CZ-800 Ion Beamer... interesting gun.
Awfully big though...." Valentine mumbled as he sized up the massive
pistol-like firearm. Pointing it at the headless corpse, he squeezed the
trigger. A bright white beam of energy shot out and blew a hole the size of a
basketball through the corpse, leaving smoking flesh in the place of his
chest cavity. "Heh... it works."
<P>
<P align="center">* * * *</p>
<P>
The squad left the Citadel, sporting the guns and ammo they’d need to stop
the robot threat, or at least aid the other Rangers that were already trying
to do so. Valentine leaned against the jeep, his newly-acquired Ion Beamer
resting in an over-sized hip holster with six extra power-packs on reserve.
Bandoliers of bullets were hanging off him like those loose strands of
bandages you see clinging onto mummy’s in those old 50’s Curse Of The Mummy
flicks. An evil-looking stockless AK-97 accompanied the many bullets.
Yukoza stood next to him, holding a glowing proton-ax (which replaced his
chainsaw sword). Brother Creed sat quietly, smoking a cigarette as he rested
in the back of the jeep, his feet hanging out of the side. Gun Wolf just
stood there, looking at his adopted "family" of militia, mercenaries,
and ex-cultists. 
<P>
He wondered why they were off doing such a thing... trying to save the
remnants of ungrateful humanity, despite the fact humanity was 80% malicious
psychopaths, rapists, raiders, thugs, and thieves. He also wondered if a
Desert Ranger badge separated people like Valentine and Yukoza from the rest
of "society". Hardcore killers for money... that’s what they were.
There was something more though... they obviously had some good in their
hearts. Just because they kill indiscriminately without pity or remorse
doesn’t make them bad... considering in most cases it’s in self-defense.
Common thing... mutated freak guy hops up out of nowhere... tries shooting
at them... the Rangers whip out their assault rifles and turn him into
ground round. In fact they have been travelling for almost a month and a half
now, trying to apply some robot pest-control to the wasteland... so obviously
they had to be good people. 
<P>
"Wolf... you’ve been sitting there for almost an hour. What’s wrong with you?"
Valentine asked as he lit up a cigarette, de-railing Gun Wolf’s train of
thought. 
<P>
"Just thinking." he replied.
<P>
"Well, we’re about to leave... this pit-stop’s over, bud... hop in the jeep,
and we’ll be off." 
<P>
"Where’s Creed and Yukoza?"
<P>
"Asleep in the car. That’s weird... I’ve never seen Yukoza sleep..."
Valentine smirked as he blew smoke from his nostrils. "You know... this
whole thing... the ‘droids... the muties... and everything else...
makes you wonder."
<P>
"Hm?" Gun Wolf raised a brow. He’d never heard Valentine speak his feelings.
He was usually just shouting out combat orders to keep the squad alive or
screaming threats and jeers at the people he fought as he blew them away.
"Wonder like how?"
<P>
"Well... I wonder how things were before all this happened. Before the nukes
were launched." He smirked, flicking his still-smoldering cigarette butt aside.
"We never would’ve had to trek across radioactive desert, kill everything
that moved, get addicted to anti-rad just to be able to walk to another
town... you know?" 
<P>
"Well shit, Val... that’s just the way it is. You can’t change what’s already
happened... you’ve got to deal with it now, because life is like a game of
poker."
<P>
"Poker?"
<P>
"Yeah... even if you’re dealed a shitty hand, you’ve still gotta play it."
<P>
Valentine smirked, and threw his AK-97 into the jeep. "Come on, Wolf.
Let’s get out of here." Valentine spoke nicely as he climbed into the
passenger’s side. "You’re driving."
<P>
Gun Wolf chuckled and climbed into the driver’s seat, clicked the emergency
brake off, and started up the engine. "So... where are we headed." 
<P>
"Darwin..."
