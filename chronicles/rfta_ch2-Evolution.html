<P>Chapter 2 - Evolution

<P>Travel was not easy in the wasteland that was one time known as New Mexico. First off, there was the lack of drinkable water. It rained little here, and either microbes or radioactive particles often contaminated what water could be found in the 
form of stagnant pools. The flowing rivers and streams were free of radioactive isotopes, having long since purged their poisons into the oceans, but were few and far between; especially during a period of drought.

<P>Second, food was scarce. Many of the plants had developed poisonous traits in their struggle to survive after the Great War, and were thus inedible to all but those who had also changed in the aftermath, acquiring the enzymes needed to neutralize 
the poison.

<P>And it was those life forms that posed the third major hazard. The struggle for survival after the war was harsh and unforgiving, the victors being the ones that could adapt the fastest. The effects of the very same war that made such changes 
necessary helped usher along this process, the residual radiation shattering the structure of their DNA and allowing it to reattach in a completely different order. Evolution had been given a huge jumpstart, and millions of years worth of evolution 
passed within the course of only eighty.

<P>It was one such creature that studied a man walking through the small arroyo, while staying hidden from sight by a clump of mutated shrubs. The local inhabitants call it the Horned Demon, and for a good reason. A descendant of the Horned Toad, a 
flat-bodied lizard no larger than a man's hand and sporting tiny bony spikes on its head and sides, had changed much. It had grown in size to match a large dog, and its spikes had grown in length and sharpness. No longer was it a harmless 
insectivore, but a carnivorous killing machine; stalking its prey and devouring it while it was still alive. And today this prey was a young man with a shotgun over one shoulder and an old backpack slung on the other.

<P>Jarrek stopped for a moment to wipe off his forehead, and blink his eye against a drop of sweat. He'd been walking for days, stopping only to sleep and eat. His confidence in his land navigation skills had slowly decreased, until he was certain 
that he was going the wrong way.

<P>He shielded his eyes from the sun with his hand and squinted off into the distance. He almost thought he saw a speck of something on the horizon. Probably nothing, but hopefully it was Cortez.

<P>He set his backpack down and sat on a sandstone rock, pulling out both canteens. Both of them empty, and not a stream or river for miles around. He cursed, stuffing them back in his pack. There wasn't a stream or river within 10 miles to fill them 
in.

<P>Aside from that, his food wouldn't last forever and hunting had been bad. He couldn't find as much as a squirrel to eat, and his stomach growled at him as a result.

<P>As he was packing his things back up he heard a soft rasping sound behind him, almost as if something was moving through the sandy bottom of the arroyo. 

<P>He glanced over his shoulder toward the noise. "What the f-"

<P>His shout was cut short as a lizard-like form slammed into him, violently knocking the air out of him and sending him crashing to the ground. He felt his head slam against a rock and the world went black...

<P>********

<P>Loki trudged along through the early fall heat, making his way carefully along the edge of a deep arroyo that was currently bereft of water.

<P>Water rationing back home was tight as usual, and the drought wasn't showing any sign of letting up. If something didn't change soon... They'd what? Pack up and leave? That wasn't an option, even if there was somewhere to go. For all we know, it 
could be worse elsewhere. 

<P>Sighing, he shook his head and continued along. This leg of his scouting was almost done, and then he could head home at last. It'd be nice to sleep in a real bed for once, and have a nice, re-hydrated meal. He might even be able to score a nice 
beef steak, if he passed around some 'caps to the right people.

<P>The thought of a real meal, real bedding, and a bit of money for a job well done helped speed him along. Might even be able to get back by tomorrow night, he thought to himself with a grin.

<P>His revere was shattered as he heard a shout ahead of him, not too far from what he could tell. It sounded human enough, although there weren't many people out here in this part of the waste, except for a few madmen and raiders.

<P>He thought for a second and decided to investigate, loosening his Desert Eagle in its holster. He could use some excitement on this damned trip anyway.

<P>Breaking into a run, he went around a bend in the arroyo, scanning for whoever or whatever made the noise. After a few moments he spotted the source.

<P>Down in the sandy bottom of the arroyo was a man, sprawled face first on the ground. Standing over him was a dark and spiky shape, which he instantly recognized as a Horned Demon. If that poor bastard was alive, he wouldn't be for long unless 
something was done.

<P>Kneeling down, he pulled his pistol free of its holster and took aim at the thing's head. He was a good shot, but a miss could be extremely unhelpful to the man's health. If he's even alive, Loki reminded himself. 

<P>He took a breath and pulled the trigger.

<P>The Horned Demon let out a grating shriek as the .50 bullet pierced through it's bony armor and imbedded itself deep in its flesh. Surprised, it quickly moved away from the person on the ground and looked around furiously for it's attacker.

<P>Seizing the chance, Loki began firing until finally the thing staggered and collapsed, dark red blood oozing from at least 6 bullet wounds.

<P>Calmly he stood, collected the used shell casings for re-use later, and re-holstered his pistol.

<P>He searched a few minutes before finding a safe way to get down into the arroyo and a few more to backtrack.

<P>Finally he came upon the body. He knelt down next to it.

<P>Loki rolled it over gently, giving it a quick examination. It was a man, that much was sure. He had slightly tilted eyes and his short hair was jet black. He probably had some Asian blood somewhere down his family tree. His clothing was of poor 
quality, and fairly dirty.

<P>What drew Loki's attention the most was the large gash near his temple. It looked like he had banged his head on a rock when he fell. Sure enough, a slightly bloodied rock nearby confirmed this. Also, he noticed that the man was breathing, so he 
was in fact alive. For the moment at least.

<P>He sighed and slid a stimpack from his belt. So much for getting back early...

<P>********

<P>&lt;&lt;It is done, Master&gt;&gt;

<P>The one known as Defiler gave a slight nod and a quick mental dismissal to the warrior, who quickly departed from his chambers, the door sliding shut with a pneumatic hiss.

<P>Now that the villagers were out of the picture, things were proceeding much as planned. He turned to study the recon report that was displayed on the wall VDU. 

<P>The population was around the number of 800, and dropping rapidly. It seems that the original number of 1,356 had dropped, due to predators, disease and radiation sickness. According to the scout, food wasn't a problem for them at this stage, 
although their water supply was running short since their purifier had ceased functioning. Attempts to bring it back online had failed up to this point.

<P>They were, however, well armed. Laser gattling turrets guarded the perimeter, and they had enough small arms to arm roughly 100 men. There would be some casualties, but they would be well under the line of acceptable losses.

<P>Defiler chuckled to himself, turning away from the VDU and leaving his chambers, heading towards the command center. It wouldn't be long now.

<P>
Vault 36 would be his.
