    <p>
    Welcome to the Reading Room.  Shh!  Rangers might be reading one of the
    many tales archived here at The Wasteland Ranger HQ-Grid.  Here you will
    discover the Wasteland genre of literature, as developed by true fans of
    the game who have taken it upon themselves to write stories based on the
    characters they have played in their own instances of the game.  In 1990,
    we self-proclaimed
    <a href="http://bsc.edu/~bassaf/maestro.html">Maestros Assaf</a>
    ventured into this fictional arena out of a devotion to not only the
    Wasteland game itself, but to the life of the characters they puppeted
    through the game. This anthology is proud to welcome the talents of
    additional authors who also are inspired to pen their imaginations in the
    Wasteland genre, which includes the post-war settings described in the
    computer role-playing games,
    <a href="fountain.html">Fountain of Dreams</a> and <a
    href="fallout.html">Fallout</a>.</p>
    <p>
    I hope that this genre
    will live on to inspire science-fiction lovers, perhaps future generations
    of bards of the desert Wasteland, as well as anyone who is looking for
    a great, classic, computer role-playing game unequalled in excellence to
    this day.</p>
    <p>
    Here are some stories written about Jax Yllandian, Taran Cyberpunk and
    their friends, including the whole cast of built-in Wasteland players:
    from the unbelievably strong Mayor Pedros and his wife Felicia, to the
    endlessly lucky Ace [Maloney]. And don't forget the radioactive buddies Mad
    Dog Fargo and Metal Maniac as well as the clip-burning and beautiful
    Christina.

    At the Yahoo! Group <a
    href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/wasteland-tales">Tales From the
    Wasteland</a> exists an ongoing effort to write more Wasteland
    stories in a collaborative-style.  I formed this on-line effort
    to allow authors to take turns writing a chapter, or story segment,
    of a story set in the Wasteland.  Each story is set up to have a circular
    queue of people, where each person waits his or her turn in the queue,
    and the first person in the queue follows the last.  If you would like to
    be a part of a story queue, head on over the
    <a href="commcenter.html">Comm Center</a> for instructions on how you
    can sign up!  Not all stories written here are round-robin style.  Some
    are solo ventures that their authors have decided to publish here first.</p>
    <p>
    Below is a listing of stories with segments written in this manner.
    Although
    they first appeared on the Yahoo! Group, they are reprinted and formatted
    here at the HQ-Grid.  Each story link opens a new browser window.</p>

    <p>
    Wasteland reaches far beyond the constructs
    of that clever masterpiece of computer entertainment known as "Wasteland."
    As David and I wondered what to do after blowing up Base Cochise,
    we looked beyond the game. We could not simply salute "farewell" to our
    Desert Rangers! As we remembered our heroes' courageous exploits
    of the past, our minds' eyes saw the desert sand of the Wasteland sifting
    before us, smacking them in the faces, waiting to be detailed.</p>

    <p />
    One summer David and I
    scribbled away with pen and paper and brought our heroes to life.
    Thus was born <cite>Tales From the Wasteland</cite>, several short story
    segments following the lives of one band of Desert Rangers under the
    leadership of the now legendary Jax Yllandian.

    "We can make this better," we thought.  Years later we did (arguably),
    launching into the production of <cite>Tales</cite>
    onto audio tape. The finished two-tape set continued the
    <a href="http://bsc.edu/~bassaf/maestro.html">studio production of
    stories</a> as our fifth audio production, and began a new era of
    producing original works.</p>

    <div class="section" id="sect_tbwl">A Tale Beyond the Wasteland (1992):</div>
    <p>
    Years after the original <cite>Tales</cite>, a new saga was born
    in the characters and real-life situations of me, Maestro Assaf the Younger,
    Bernard Assaf.  Under the leadership of Drake Who, Ph.D. and Napalm,
    this group of Desert Rangers escaped the Wasteland into reality, as
    detailed in the second Wasteland installment, <cite>A Tale Beyond the
    Wasteland</cite>, written by the Assaf brothers.</p>

    This story was written with the
    intent to eventually produce it onto audio tape.  We did.  Thus was
    created our sixth <a href="http://bsc.edu/~bassaf/maestro.html">story production</a>,
    and our second Wasteland audio saga.  Below

    Having the urge to pen a short story about my favorite of all the
    Wasteland characters (who shall remain nameless
    at this time!), I racked my brain for a plot.
    Thus finding one, I scribbled away and out popped the first solo-authored
    Wasteland story, <cite>The Tale of Mr. Grizzly</cite>: a story of a

    <div class="section" id="sect_fod">Fountain of Dreams (1997):</div>
    <p>
    The Wasteland Story anthology, for a brief while, was
    proud to accept the talents of Ranger Jordan Boos
    who wrote a story set in the <a
       href="fountain.html">Fountain of Dreams</a> setting.  Boos revised
    his story in November 1998, but three years later decided he would pull
    it off the shelves.  Here is what he had to say about his story, years
    after he wrote it:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
       Hello. You wouldn't remember me, but a long time ago I submitted 
       the story 'Fountain of Dreams' to the Wasteland HQ grid. Then, a 
       while later, I submitted a revision, which didn't really improve 
       on anything. I guess I can't leave bad enough alone, so...
       <p />
       I humbly ask for mercy: Could you please remove that story from 
       your site? I found it while trawling my old files, and... well... 
       it's frankly horrible. Disturbing in content and just about 
       plotless... yep, fairly awful. It doesn't really add much to the 
       site, and in comparison to the other stories on the site, it's 
       that much worse.
       <p />
       Thanks for having the heart to put it up in the first place (at 
       the time, it was certainly an ego boost to my frail teenaged 
       heart), but I really think the story's time has come to disappear 
       out of existence. 
       <p />
       Please erase it. For the children.
       <p />
       - Jordan Boos
    </blockquote>

    I asked Ranger Boos if he wouldn't mind if I posted his retraction to
    the site, for its humorous content.  He agreed, so here it is.  R.I.P.

    A manila folder is rolled up in the tube, a small post-it note attached
    to the front reads, 'Enclosed within this folder are
    <a href="javascript:PopUpStory('chronicles/rfta_ch1-Departures.html')">Chapter 1</a> and
    <a href="javascript:PopUpStory('chronicles/rfta_ch2-Evolution.html')">[Chapter] 2</a> of
    a Fallout-based fanfic in progress. It came to my attention that you
    post Fallout fanfics as well as Wasteland ones, so I decided to send
    this these to you for archival purposes. Please note that the author is
    extremely inept at writing, and I am not to be held accountable in any
    way for harmful cranial seepage that may occur as a result of reading
    enclosed documents.'</p>

    <strong>Yet another sealed metal tube</strong></p>
    <p>
    Late at night as you are just about to settle into bed, you hear a
    knocking on your door. Wondering who would be at your door at 2am,
    you answer it. There is, however, not a soul to be found. Just as you're
    about to head back inside, the glint of metal draws your attention.
    Kneeling down, you see another sealed metal tube, this one looking to
    be in slightly better condition than the last, the geiger counter reading
    well within the green zone. You pop open the tube, and a small VidCD
    slides out and into your hand. You quickly head inside and pop the CD
    into a player.</p>
    <p>
    You're greeted by at first a dark screen, which slowly lightens,
    revealing a human shaped figure sitting behind a large redwood desk.
    The light is coming from behind the figure, making it impossible to make out
    his exact features.</p>
    <p>
    "Mr. Assaf, unless this material has been compromised, you're one of the
    select few to have this... Sensitive information. It would appear that my
    employer, a one Mr. Blue, neglected to include the name of his writing
    project with the last parcel. I have been instructed to give you that
    information."</p>
    <p>
    The figure shifts a bit in the desk, shifting closer towards the foreground.
    </p>
    <p>
    "<cite>Rise from the Ashes</cite> is the official name for now.
    Inclosed [sic] on this disk is the next installment,
    <a href="javascript:PopUpStory('chronicles/rfta_ch3-Home.html')">Chapter 3</a>.
    You may post it in any public place
    you deem fit, but any attempts to modify the contents would be... Unpleasant
    for all of us. I trust your judgement will serve you well."</p>
    <p>
    The screen fades to darkness again, to be then replaced by the words,</p>
    <p>
    "Print hardcopy?"</p>

    <strong>The plot thickens...</strong>
    <p>
    [<a href="javascript:PopUpStory('chronicles/rfta_ch4-Mobilization.html')">Chapter 4</a> speaks for
    itself.]</p>

    Unfortunately, Terminal Blue either never finished his story or never
    submitted it to the Rangers stationed here at the HQ-Grid for publication.

    <p>
	In late 2008, <cite><a href="#sect_wowmg">With or Without My Gun</a></cite> author David
	Assaf gasped as the Lone Wanderer exited Vault 101 and beheld a barren world, long in ruin,
	drenched in the somber grayscale of a moonlit night. This remarkable scene early in Fallout 3
	illustrated perfectly to him how much Bethesda's developers had been inspired by Cormack
	McCarthy's <cite>The Road</cite>. And so too did he become inspired to keep a sporadic diary
	of sorts, of the Lone Wanderer's adventures, written from his POV. It quickly morphed into
	something else. Fast forward to 2019. David revisited the diary entries, dusted them off,
	polished them up, and posted them to <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/wasteland-tales">Tales
	From the Wasteland</a>. Tycho's story is a heroic epic set in the wasteland---not the one
	inhabited by our beloved Desert Rangers, but one yet familiar perhaps, and not too far removed.
