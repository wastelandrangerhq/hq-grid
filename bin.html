    1.
    Here is a listing of the binaries (official computer term for "executable
    program") available here for download.  Admittedly, there are not many;
    if you have a Wasteland-esque binary you'd like me to post (NOT including
    original game programs, for those of you who will ask), send it on to me!
    I'll be happy to upload it here for Rangers world-wide to download.
    </p>
    <p>
    2.
    Also here are links to other Wasteland-related projects with homes on the
    Internet.  There are several home-made Wasteland games, or
    Wasteland-esque games under construction by dedicated Rangers around the
    globe.  Since at many of these sites binaries are available for download,
    for either game-play or for helping with the co-creation of the game, I
    thought links to these games were appropriately placed here.
    </p>

    <strong>Disclaimer:</strong>
    I do not purport that the helper applications or charater downloads
    run or run correctly on any system.  I have not thoroughly tested them.
    Therefore, use at your own risk and with Geiger Counter in hand!  The

    Ranger HQ-Grid will not be held liable for any screwed-up game files.
    If you are smart, you'll make copies of your files before you start
    hacking them!

    <strong>A Mostly All Badass NPC Party</strong>
    <span class="red">[IBM-PC]</span>
    </p>
    <p>
    Description:
    Ranger Shooter J submits this band of NPC Rangers, assembled and inserted
    into a fresh instance of the game.  Here's what he has to say:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
    When I first played
    this game on C64, I used the disk-switching "cheat" to make a party of
    all NPCs. I wanted to see how I could do If I wasnt permitted to go
    full-auto whenever I wanted. Well, I got "<a
    href="http://www.dragonplay.com/rpgarchives.html">Ultimate RPG archives</a>"
    and used the edit command to make another all NPCs party. I've started them
    out on a fresh file (nothing has been touched) and they have all the
    best items. (You can drop them for more fun, of course.) This one has
    mostly all badass NPCs, except Dan Citrine, but I've found that if you
    take some of the weaker NPCs "all the way" they turn out to be pretty
    cool. (especially JACKIE and FELICIA, believe it or not!) Have fun with
    the file. <strong>Just install Wasteland, delete the "GAME1" file, paste the
    attached file, and rename it "GAME1".</strong>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
    There you have it, have fun!  I loaded it myself, and it looks like all the
    characters are indeed "bad-ass," as they each tote power armor and a
    proton ax.  GROOVY.

    Commentary:
    While Newcomer isn't a Wasteland prequel, sequel, or even in the same
    post-nuclear war genre, this dedicated team of Hungarian programmers
    put together a nice game for the C64 platform, that was inspired in
    part by Wasteland.  Originally I beta-tested their earliest versions, and
    they publicly acknoweldge me (see the "Creation" sub page) and link to
    the HQ-Grid, for which I am very grateful.
    I have kept in touch with them over the years and
    am happy to provide a link here where you might browse the Newcomer home
    page and download the binaries for your own gaming fun.

    <strong>Wasteland Zero</strong>
    <span class="red">[IBM-PC]</span><br />
    </p>

    <p>
    Commentary:
    The first of the home made Wasteland games that came to the attention of
    the HQ-Grid, Wasteland Zero was a college project put together by Ranger
    Quan Thai and his friends.  Here's what Quan originally wrote about
    the project.  <!-- Quan Thai: quanthai@comcast.net -->
    </p>

    <blockquote>Basically, its 
      supposed to be a pre-quel to Wasteland -- explaining the events 
      that led to the apocalypse.
      [We] currently have a rough beta that is on my homepage.
      <p />

      <!-- bad links: -->
      <!-- Original location: http://internet.oit.osshe.edu/~thaiq -->
      <!-- Second location: http://www.quanthai.com/~wland0/ -->

      We've got an editor (Windows-based)
      and the game engine (DOS-based but can run under 95) so 
      you can create maps/events in the editor and see the effects in the 
      engine.  Also, the game and editor is being released under the 
      GPL so anyone can play with the source code and hopefully speed 
      up development.  Try it out, and let me know what you think ... 
    </blockquote>

    <p>
    Sadly, it does not appear that any progress has been made on this game
    since 1999, and in addition both the Internet locations for this
    fan-based Wasteland sequel are now offline.  I did get an e-mail from one
    of the developers back in September of 2002, who said:

    <blockquote>
    Well, Wasteland Zero didn't get as far as we expected, everyone pretty
    much finished junior project, eventually graduated, and then moved on and
    got good jobs. That was 1999. Now we are all out of work and resuming
    work on Wasteland Zero!! We are throwing out loads of old code,
    (including those crappy open source graphics routines that kept it from
    running in anything buy a 98 dos window) and making ita actual PROJECT
    FOR FUN instead of a good example of object oriented design, and things
    are going MUCH BETTER!!!  (Yet somewhat uglier code-wise)
    <p />
    Anyway, Quan's legacy Wasteland Zero page is located here UPDATE YOUR
    LINKS!:
    <p />
    http://www.quanthai.com/~wland0/
    <p />
    We don't plan on updating that page, its our legacy stuff, but maybe
    there will be more info posted on techgoon.com or wilx.org,
    spacenacho.com or even jollython.com (The sites of the other writers and
    artists and remenents of the old project team! :)
    <p />
    - Beta Tester, Artist and "Tile Thief", Wil
    <p />
    PS: Our latest editor MAY be on quanthai.com soon with loads of new tiles
    and an ACTUAL FUNCTIONAL event trigger menu. Thank you very much for
    providing so many wasteland resources online!

    </blockquote>
    </p>

    <p>
    In May 2004, I received word from Quan that the project was indeed dead.
    <blockquote>
    Hi Ben.  Wow, talking about memories ;-)  Anyway, I'm sad to announce
    that the project has been discontinued due to lack of interest.  I still
    have the code (and all the corresponding documentation) on a CD
    somewhere.  If there are still some souls out there that are interested
    in it, I can post it ... Thanks.
